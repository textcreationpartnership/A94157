            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I confeſs that I am bound to many of you in courteſie, to all in duty, and I know not better how to expreſs my thankfulneſs to ſome, and my faithfulneſs to all, then by deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uprightly with you in the concernments of your ſouls.
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.9</note> 
               <hi>God is my witneſs whom I</hi> (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to) <hi>ſerve with my ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Son, that without ceaſing, I make mention of you always in my prayers:</hi> And can through the ſtrength of Chriſt, much more rejoyce in one of your converſions, then in all your poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb facs="tcp:170410:3"/>Ye know what a large Epiſtle I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written to you (I beſeech you to read it often,
<note place="margin">To the Reader, in Hell and Heaven epitomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:</note> and) O that the Lord would write it within you. We live in days that are full of diviſion; but all that have any face of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or form of godlineſs, will acknowledge the things which I have written to you, to be the commandments of God. My cheif work is, and hath been to preach unto you <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which are of ſuch infinite weight in order to your unchangeable welfares. And could I prevaile with you heartily to embrace thoſe eſſentials of Gods word, I ſhould have confidence of your joyful appearance in the other world. Tis a ſign of a very foul ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, to loath ſuch ſolid food as thoſe vitals of Chriſtianity are, and to pick at Kickſhaws or Sallads, (I mean either) the new-fangled opinions of ſome upſtart way, or the vaine flouriſhes of humane wit. O how gladly would I ſtand forth to your comfort at the judgment feat of Chriſt! which that I may, I earneſtly requeſt you again and again (in obedience to your bleſſed Saviour, and for the ſake of your precious ſouls) to ponder and practice theſe three particulars. Conſider, that they are not onely commended to you by your weak and dying Miniſter, but commanded you by your Maker, who will within a ſhort time reckon with you for the performance of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Make conſcience of, &amp; be diligent about the means of grace; neglect not ſecret, private
<pb facs="tcp:170410:3"/>or publick ordinances. Your bodies may as probably live without diet, as your ſouls without duties. This is Gods way by which he infuſeth grace where it is wanting, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth grace where it is. As the head by the nerves and ſinews as organs, conveyeth ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits to the whole body; So doth the Churches head Chriſt Jeſus by ordinances convey his Spirit and grace to his members. Doth not experience teach you, that your hearts are like water, though heated a little while over the fire of the means of grace, yet are no ſooner taken off, but they are returning to their former coldneſs? Mariners that ſwim againſt wind and tide, muſt row hard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at it, if they intermit but a little while, how far and how forcibly are they carried backwards! It is not unknown to you (if ye have any knowledge in ſpiritual affaires) how buſily and unweariedly the Devil, world and fleſh are drawing you to hell; it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth you to be always, by duties, fetching in ſupplies from above, if ever ye would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at heaven. I do not wonder that many in our perillous times, (who live above duties) are given up to ſenſuality or blaſphemies. The Papiſts ſay that if they can get the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants out of their ſtrong holds of Scripture, into the open fields of Councils and Fathers, they ſhould quickly be able to foil them. If Satan can prevaile with men but to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Word of God (which is the ſword of the Spirit,) and the prayer of faith (which
<pb facs="tcp:170410:4"/>engageth Chriſt himſelf in the combat) he will never doubt the conqueſt. While men wall in the Kings high way, between Sun and Sun, they have the protection of the Law; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is at their own peril; If you keep the way of God, he will be your guard; but if you wander and leave him, no wonder if he leave you. And certainly wo will be to you, when God departeth from you. A dreadful night of darkneſs muſt needs be expected, when this Sun is departed.</p>
            <p>The miniſtry of the word is called <hi>the ſalt of the earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> Saints are called <hi>Doves; Who are thoſe that fly as doves to their windows!</hi> Now the property of Doves, is to be exceedingly in love with a ſalt-ſtone. Kites and Rooks care little for it, but Doves are mightily inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it: Graceleſs perſons neglect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the means of grace, but they that ever enjoyed God in them, cannot but ſet a due price upon them. The beggar, the poor in ſpirit will know that door again, at which he hath received a good dole; <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for by them thou haſt quickned me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Mind the religious education of your children. <hi>Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> It was the wiſh of <hi>Crates,</hi> that he were upon the top of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hill in the world, that from thence he might cry out againſt monſtrous parents, that toile to leave their children great eſtates, but take no care what maner of perſons they ſhould be which ſhould enjoy thoſe eſtates.
<pb facs="tcp:170410:4"/>I doubt not but ye are careful to breed your Sons Gentlemen, or to bring them up to trades, that they may know how to live a few days in this world; but alas how few of you are ſolicitous, to breed them new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to bring them up to Chriſtianity, that they may know how to live for ever, in the other world! I remember that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks mournfully, <hi>Some praiſe my father for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſuch coſt (even beyond his eſtate) in my nurture, but alas his care was to make me an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, not to make me a Chriſtian.</hi> I am confident, many a child bemoans that, now he is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hell, which the <hi>Father</hi> did when he was converted on earth. I cannot condemn the education of children according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their parents, nor their bringing up to particular callings (this latter I am ſure is a duty) but that which is <hi>firſt</hi> ſhould be <hi>laſt,</hi> and that which is <hi>laſt</hi> ſhould be <hi>firſt.</hi> Your greateſt care, and that in the firſt place, ſhould be to ſeek the Kingdom of God, for your ſelves and children, and then other things ſhall be added to you; <hi>Caleb</hi> gave his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the upper and the neather ſprings. O la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that yours may with <hi>Jacob</hi> have the dews of heaven as well as the fatneſs of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliſha</hi> wept when he ſaw <hi>Hazael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 3.12, 13.</note> and foreſaw that he would ſlay young men, and daſh the children againſt the wall: do nor ſome of you give far far greater occaſion of weeping (if poſſible, teares of blood) in ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:170410:5"/>and murdering the ſouls of your dear children, teaching them by your patterns, to live like Heathens and Atheiſts! Believe it, God committeth the charge of, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with you for all the ſouls in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.3, 10, 11.</note> When <hi>Cain</hi> had flain his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> God called to him, <hi>Where is thy Brother</hi> Abel? <hi>And Cain ſaid, I know not, am I my Brothers keeper, And the Lord ſaid, What haſt thou done? the voice of thy brothers blood cryeth unto me from the ground. And now thou art curſed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother, blood at thine hand.</hi> So ſuppoſe God ſhould whiſper one of you in the eare, <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Father, Careleſs Maſter, Where is thy child or ſervant, that dyed ſo many months or years ago?</hi> You may poſſibly think what <hi>Cain</hi> ſpake, <hi>Lord I know not (whether in heaven or hell.)</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Holy Greenham</hi> ſaith, that many mens children ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them up and down in hell, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of them, for neglecting to inſtruct them.</note> Was I their keeper? (O think of it with ſpeed and reform.) May not God reply very truly, <hi>Curſed ſinner, vile wretch, What haſt thou done? The voice of thy child, of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſoul-blood cryeth to me from hell. And now thou art curſed from hell, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy ſons, thy ſervants ſoul at thine hand.</hi> Friends, Friends, what will you do, when God ſhall thus deal with you, for your neglect of relative duties! Poſſibly ye may think I deal too ſharply; but truly the reaſon is becauſe I know that ſin will not deal mildly, either with you or yours; And ſhould I not give you warning, the blood of your own and childrens ſouls, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb facs="tcp:170410:5"/>at my hands. Good Lord that ye did but believe what it is to be guilty of others blood! Heathens and Infidels provide for the body and temporall well-being of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and what do many of you more? Bears that bring forth miſhapen whelps, will by licking them, bring them to a better form. Your Children are brought forth enemies to God, and are by nature children of wrath, and heirs of eternal death; doth it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove you to ſtrive that by religious nurture, they may become children of the promiſe, and heirs of eternal life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Make ſure of Regeneration;</hi> be never ſatisfyed, till ye can upon Scripture grounds affirme that your natures are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. This, this is the one thing neceſſary, Your <hi>All</hi> hangs upon this hinge. If this be not done, ye are undone, undone eternally.

And how miſerable and unexcuſable wilt thou prove, if thou be after all this a ſtranger to the life of faith, of holineſs! If nature had made thee a ſpiritual perſon, a child of God, and an heir of heaven, this Doctrine of
<pb facs="tcp:170410:12"/>Regeneration might then be received as ſtrangely as it was by <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and as neglectfully as it is by careleſs worldlings, and as diſdainfully as it is by unbelieving and malignant enemies of the Holy Ghoſt. But ſooner may you hope to find a new way into the world or a ſtate of nature, beſides the way of humane birth, then to find another way into the ſtate of grace, and the Kingdom of Heaven, beſide the <hi>New birth,</hi> by the Spirit. Nature proclaimeth its own vitioſity, to every diligent obſerver. He that is ſo carnall as not to obſerve it, in the croſſeneſs and rebellion of his ſoul againſt God, and the worlds captivity to <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> one would think ſhould yet be ſo rational as to obſerve it, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and inordinate behaviour of men to one another; While <hi>ſelf</hi> is exalted againſt the good of friends and Neighbours, yea and againſt the common good, and that ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably as the wars and calamities of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do ſignifie. For whence come wars and fightings among men? come they not hence? even of their luſts that war in their members? <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. But the corrupted ſoul is ſo conforme to the worlds corrupted ſtate, that it is no wonder if he perceive no need of a Reſtorer, and ſo be in heart an Infidel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account; As a man born blind, may think the world hath no great need of the Sun, becauſe his eyes are ſo conform to a ſtate of darkneſs, that the night ſeemeth to
<pb facs="tcp:170410:12"/>him as good as the day. As all the creatures which we daily ſee, condemne the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> that denieth their Creator: So all the ſpots and blemiſhes of the creatures, eſpecially the univerſal pravity of mankind, condemneth the Infidel, that ſeeing not Original ſin and miſery, denieth the neceſſity of a redeemer: And the holineſs of renewed ſouls about him, doth further condemne him, that doth not acknowledge the <hi>ſanctifier,</hi> who is the Cauſe. The <hi>Reparation</hi> of <hi>vitiated nature,</hi> is a myſterious, but glorious work of God, which Angels deſire to pry into, and all the Regenerate rejoyce in and admire, as having themſelves been made partakers of ſo ſweet and excellent a ſhare. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſs is a confederacy of wicked Angels and men, that are all ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by one malicious principal Governour. (<hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24, <hi>to</hi> 30. <hi>and</hi> 25, 41. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) whoſe work is to marr the work of God, that nature may not attaine its primitive and proper end. And the Kingdome of Chriſt, is the holy ſociety headed by him, that hath made it his undertaken work, to be the repairer of depraved nature, and to deſtroy the works of the Divel, and to remove impediments, and conquer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and carry on his healing work, that nature may yet attaine its ends, in deſpight of ſin, and death and Hell.</p>
            <p>As ever you would not be guilty of contemning this wonderful work of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:170410:13"/>Reparation, Elevation, and Perfection,</hi> ſee now that you over-look not the great neceſſity of it in your ſelves, where one would think, as it doth moſt neerly concern you, ſo it ſhould be moſt eaſy to you to perceive it; No part of nature is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratly vitiated as the ſoul of man, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Divels.) This was thy caſe that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt theſe words, (as well as mine and all mens els:) and if thou art not Reſtored by renewing grace, it is thy caſe ſtill, it is Satans buſineſs to keep thee from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, leſt the knowledge of thy miſery ſhould waken thee to accept and mind the cure. If he can make thee forget it, or deceive thee by flatterers, and by a ſeeming formal outſide religiouſneſs, and quiet thee in thy miſery, till there be no remedy, but time is paſt, and mercy gone, then is he the conquerour, and hath the prey he aimed at, and thou art loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>Thy ſalvation or damnation lieth on thy eſcaping this deceit, and the preſumption, ſecurity, and impenitencie, that are its conſequents; For this end, thou haſt the plain directions of Gods word, the frequent warnings, the cloſe convictions, the fervent exhortations of his Miniſters: If the Spirit ſet in, and theſe prevaile, and thou give up thy ſelf unreſervedly to the Lord, thou art a happy man, and hath received the beginning of life eternall.

<pb facs="tcp:170410:14"/>and of the ſpirit and grace that works by them; and this is the buſineſs that above other buſineſs, lyeth upon thee in this preſent world: even to work now in thy ſoul, that holy love to the moſt bleſſed God, who is love it ſelf, which may cauſe thee here to thirſt after his preſence, and to ſeek his favour, and to do his will, and may fit thee delightfully for ever to enjoy him, and everlaſtingly to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced in the beholding of his glory, in the feeling of his love, and in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly praiſes, and the fulfilling of his will. An unregenerate, unholy ſoul is as unfit for this, as thy mortal enemy to lye in thy boſome, or as toads and ſerpents, to be the familiar companions of men; or as thy Ox or Aſs is to feed with thee at thy table, and lye with thee in thy bed.

Thou loveſt not holineſs here, nor the very imperfect Saints that have it; how much leſs couldſt thou love the infinite holineſs of God, who hateth thy ſins ten thouſand times more, then the moſt ſevere and ſharp reprover hates them!
<pb facs="tcp:170410:14"/>If thy eyes cannot look upon the ſmalleſt candle without offence, how then would they endure to look upon the Sun, and that in the neareſt acceſs unto its glory? And if here thy enmity to the holy will of God be ſuch, that thou pleaſeſt not him, and he and his waies are diſpleaſing unto thee; how uncapable art thou of Heaven, which is a ſtate of mutual full delight, where the Saints do perfectly pleaſe the Lord, and are perfectly pleaſed in him and his pleaſure? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>They that are after the fleſh, do mind</hi> (or ſavour) <hi>the things of the fleſh; but they that are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit: To be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace; Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be: So then, they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> And <hi>that which is born of the fleſh, is</hi> (but) <hi>fleſh: As that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit.</hi> Joh. 3.6. It is therefore undenyable, that till you are born of the ſpirit, and ſo made ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, all your Religion and civility leaveth you but enemies to God, and in a ſtate of Rebellion againſt his will, and conſequently in a ſtate of death; Baptiſm which is the Sacrament of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, doth ſignifie this change, and containe your profeſſion, and engagement to the Lord.

            <p>But I muſt not ſtand too long inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you at the door, when my buſineſs is to call you in, and to tell you that here is a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to you from the Lord; <hi>A Treatiſe of Regeneration,</hi> the moſt neceſſary Subject, in a ſtile ſo clean and cloſe, in words ſo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, plain, powerful and preſſing, that undoubtedly by a ſerious impartial peruſal, joyned with ſober conſideration and prayer, thy ſoul may receive unſpeakable commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. Though I know not the Author, I am ſo far acquainted with the ſpirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in this Diſcourſe, that I dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee he had very much help from heaven; and dare encourage thee to ſtudy this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury Treatiſe, as that which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt certain, ſound, and neceſſary doctrine, directly tending to the ſaving of thy ſoul, without any tendency to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Schiſm, or uncharitable cenforiouſneſs: A Doctrine neceſſary for the learned or unlearned, the rich and the poor, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and the baſe, and for men of all degrees and ranks: which if it had been more heartily ſtudied, and inculcated in publick and in private, by all Preachers of the Goſpel, inſtead of the humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:170410:15"/>and Canons, and Opinions, and intereſts of their ſeveral Sects, the Church and the conſciences of the Paſtors and their Flocks had been now much wholer and ſounder then they are. Believe it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, thou ſhalt never be ſaved for being a Lord, or a Knight, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a rich man, a learned man, or a well-ſpoken eloquent man; nor yet for being a Calviniſt, or a Lutheran, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian, an Anabaptiſt, a Prelatiſt, a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, an Independent, or a Proteſtant formally and meerly as ſuch, much leſs for being a Papiſt or of any ſuch groſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Sect: but as a <hi>Regenerate Chriſtian</hi> it is that thou muſt be ſaved, or thou canſt have no hope. If once this renewing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit have taken poſſeſſion of thy ſoul, and thou art made partaker of the Divine and Heavenly nature, and art become a living Member of Chriſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved, though thou know not whether Dioceſan Biſhops, Metropolitans, Primates and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, or onely Parochial Biſhops be moſt agreeable to the minde of God; and though thou know not whether any other Book than the Bible ſhould contain the Liturgy of the Church; and though thou know not in a hundred controverſies of the times, about Orders and Forms, and Ceremonies, and ſmaller points of doctrine, which party it is that is in the right. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs will ſave thee without the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

            <p>To you that are Regenerate I ſhall ſay but this, keep very honourable and thankful thoughts of your ſpiritual birth; Live now as the ſons of the Eternal God, and as the heirs of everlaſting life: Set your faces now towards Heaven, as thoſe that ſee the grave at hand, and the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world all vaniſhing into ſmoak, and as thoſe that are reſolved to have heaven or nothing. Away with the ſins, the baits and company that formerly were your deſire and delight. And ſeeing even the firſt hour of your converſion, there is joy in heaven before the Angels for your ſakes, for ſhame walk not in too much dejectedneſs and deſpondency, but keep a harmony and concent with heaven, ſeeing you are ſo highly concernd in the matter of their joy.

            <p>In this third Chapter we have firſt, Chriſt teaching <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> to verſ. 21.</p>

               </gap>s teſtimony concerning Chriſt, to the end.</p>
            <p>The Text is Chriſts ſpeech to <hi>Nicodemus; Nicodemus</hi> had ſeen Chriſts miracles, and thereby was convinced to come unto him; Chriſt lets him hear his oracles, that thereby he might be converted, and come unto him: <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the ſecond verſe had called Chriſt <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and confeſſed him to be a Teacher ſent from God; Chriſt in purfuance of that Office, ſets him his leſſon, aſſuring him that he muſt learn it in the School of earth, or he can never be removed to the Univerſity of Heaven.</p>
            <p>In the words we obſerve two general parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, An Affirmation, or the neceſſity of Regeneration, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:170410:18"/>
            <p> Secondly, Its confirmation or the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of that aſſertion; <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Affirmation we may take notice of two particulars;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The univerſality of the perſons, <hi>A Man,</hi> that is every man; the propoſition is indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and ſo equivalent to one that is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The quality of the thing affirmed, <hi>Be born again;</hi> mending will not ſerve, the whole man muſt be new made; <hi>Non unius partis correctionem, ſed totius naturae renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem deſignat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> It ſpeakes not the reparation of one part, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of the whole man.</p>
            <p>In the Confirmation of it there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe two things conſiderable;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The manner of the expreſſion, <hi>Verily, verily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Author of it, <hi>I ſay unto thee.</hi>

            <p>The meaning of the words.</p>

And when it is doubled, as here by the great Prophet, it is a vehement aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſtrong confirmation of the thing aſſerted: As if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>

Nature may in ſome men be dung'd with induſtry, art, education, and example, and thereby ſhew fair, ſpread far, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top others, but yet manured to the utmoſt, it is but Nature ſtill: Its grapes will be the grapes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and its cluſters the cluſters of <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> The natural man like <hi>Zacheus</hi> is too low of ſtature to ſee Jeſus, <hi>he diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the things of God neither indeed can he, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> Cor. 2.14. The wiſeſt Philoſophers that could cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pick the lock of Natures Cabinet, and behold much of her riches and treaſure, were meer Ideots and fools in the things of the Spirit, and underſtood no more of theſe myſteries of Divinity, then a Cowherd doth

Water riſeth no higher then its fountain; the light within us, or Nature, is but a ruſh candle, and cannot enable us to ſee the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: the light without us, or Scripture, is the ſtar to the wiſe men leading us to the place where the Babe of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> lieth.

Oh what a bleſſed pattern have we here for our practices, when our Pariſhoners come to us, or we go to them! what more weighty ſubject can we treat of then their Converſion! without which they muſt be

               <p>For the illuſtration of this truth I ſhall ſhew firſt what this Regeneration or New Birth is, and then give you the Reaſons why none can avoid the Second Death, unleſs they are acquainted with the Second Birth.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Regeneration is a work of Gods Spirit, whereby he doth out of his meer good pleaſure, for his own glory, and the ſalvation of his Elect, at firſt renew the whole man after his own image, by the Miniſtry of the Word. I ſhall explain this definition by taking it in piece; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in it the ſeveral cauſes of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When Arras hangings are opened and unfolded, their richneſs will appear.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I call it <hi>a work of Gods Spirit;</hi> here is the efficient principal cauſe of it. The Babe of Grace in this reſpect calleth none on earth Father. It is by the Spirits over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing the ſoul, that this New creature is conceived and brought forth; godlineſs is not natural, but adventitious to man; not by propagation, but by donation. Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not generate himſelf naturally, much leſs regenerate himſelf ſpiritually; they which are born of the fleſh contribute nothing to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170410:22"/>their own beings, neither do they which are born of the Spirit, bring any thing to their new beings, unleſs it be a paſſive receptive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they are reaſonable creatures. Some read the Text, and not unfitly (for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal will fully bear it, <hi>Except a man be born</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This work is ſomtimes called a tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the natural wilde olive-tree, and ingraffing it contrary to nature into a true good Olive-tree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. out of the firſt into the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> now the Cions cannot tranſplant or ingraff it ſelf. It is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a <hi>new creation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. To create or bring ſomething out of nothing is beyond the power of the ſtrongeſt creature it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſtrength of all men and Angels to create the leaſt pile of graſs; God challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth this as his prerogative royal, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40, 26. As the old heaven and earth were the work of his hands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. ſo are the new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid truly, <hi>To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the little world, Man, is more then to create the great world.</hi> It is further ſtiled a Reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170410:23"/>and 2.5. It is a great work to recover a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing body, a far greater to reſtore one that is dead to life, but the greateſt of all to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven a dead ſoul; in the former there is no oppoſition, in this there is much. <hi>In ſpight of man and devils to pull down the ugly rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten frame of ſin, and ſet up the lovely laſting Fabrick of ſanctity, requireth no leſs ſtrength then Omnipotency. The Almighty God putteth forth the exceeding greatneſs of his power in forming the New creature,</hi> Epheſ. 1.19, 20. nay the ſame power which he did <hi>in raiſing up Ieſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi> who had beſide the watch of <hi>Romans,</hi> and the malice of hell, ſuch an heavy weight as the ſins of the world to keep him down.</p>
               <p>Repentance and Faith are the two chief ingredients in this rare compoſition, and neither of them are ſuch drugs as grow in Natures Garden; no, they are fetched from far: <hi>It is God that giveth to the Gentiles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life, Acts</hi> 11.18. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.25. The ſtones will as ſoon weep as mans heart of ſtone, unleſs he that ſmote the rock force water out of it, by turning it into a heart of fleſh for <hi>Faith alſo it is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8.

               <p> Secondly, I ſay <hi>Whereby God out of his meer good pleaſure,</hi> here is the impulſive or moving cauſe of Regeneration; <hi>Of his own will begat he us again by the word of truth,</hi> Jam. 1.18 Gods good will is the higheſt moving cauſe of this gracious work; 'twas not any fore-ſight of Faith or good works, not any thing without him that turned the ſcale of his thoughts for thy purity and peace, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own good pleaſure and pity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.21, 22. therefore he is ſaid to give <hi>a new heart,</hi> verſe 26, 27. becauſe he beſtoweth it freely, not for mans merit, but from his own mercy: The gift of grace is meerly of grace; <hi>For we our ſelves,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>were ſometimes diſobedient, fooliſh, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures; But after that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared; Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Titus 3.3, 4, 5. ſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, to 6. verſe. If you would know the grand reaſon why ſome are taken (by the net of the Word, let down in the ſea of the world) when others are left; why ſome like wax are melted before this fire of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, when others like clay are hardned; why ſome have the light ſide of this glorious pillar towards them, when others have the dark ſide of it; why the ſame path of the red ſea is ſalvation to ſome, when it is deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others; why the <hi>myſteries of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170410:24"/>of heaven are revealed to babes, when they are hid from the wiſe and prudent:</hi> I muſt give you the ſame reaſon which Chriſt himſelf doth, <hi>Even ſo Father, becauſe it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in thy ſight,</hi> Matth. 11.27. his will and mercy are the cauſe of all our <hi>felicity, Rom:</hi> 9.18. 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.3. <hi>Deut:</hi> 7.7, 8. Grace chuſeth thee, <hi>Rom:</hi> 11.5. <hi>There is a remnant according to the election of Grace;</hi> ſo <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 1.5.

Grace diſtinguiſheth and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth thee from others, <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly by his Grace;</hi> Grace glorifieth, <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 2.8. <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved;</hi> Grace doth lay both the foundation and the top-ſtone of glory: that deſerveth the thanks and praiſe of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, progreſs, and perfection in holineſs. Every ſtep in our aſcent to mount <hi>Sion</hi> is free-ſtone; Every link, as one obſerveth well, in the golden chain of mans ſalvation, is richly enameled with Free-grace. O how lively doth this lovely Attribute play its part from firſt to laſt in the recovery of loſt man!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here is the inſtrumental cauſe. I ſay, <hi>by the Miniſtry of the Word. Of his own will begat he us again by the word of truth,</hi> Jam: 1.18. Scripture is the ordinary means of converſion; <hi>The Goſpel of Chriſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170410:25"/>is the power of God unto ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 1.16. God indeed is a free agent, working when, in what manner, and by what means he pleaſeth; though he tieth us to means, he doth not tie himſelf to means; he doth ſometimes make relations the inſtruments of Regeneration; ſome by being matched to Chriſtians, have been married to Chriſt; ſome matches which have begun in the fleſh, have ended in the ſpirit; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telleth the beleiving Wife, <hi>ſhe knoweth not but ſhe may ſave her Husband; and the beleiving Husband he knoweth not but he may ſave his wife,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1 God hath made pious education effectual for childrens converſion: The mornings draught of wholeſom inſtruction hath preſerved many young ones from infection by, and perdition with others, 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3.15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. Some Maſters have alſo been ſpiritual fathers to their ſervants; there are thoſe that by being of the family of the faithful, have come to be of the family of Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.1. <hi>Ioſh:</hi> 24. God ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth by ſufferings; Affliction like the Shepherds dog hath brought thoſe home into the fold of Chriſt which went aſtray like loſt ſheep: God hath caſt ſome <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> and Prodigals that were hard mettal, into ſome hot fire, and thereby melted them and fitted them to receive his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and image, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 33.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:170410:25"/>
               <p> But uſually the Minſtry of the word is the pen in the hand of the Holy Ghoſt, with which he writeth the Law of God in the heart. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſoul, Pſal.</hi> 19.7. 'Tis the incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeed of the word, which by thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall husbandmen is thrown into the ſoil of mens hearts, that through the influence of the Son of righteouſneſſe and dews of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſpringeth up in grace and holineſſe.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. Ordinarily there is no other way to beget grace, then the word of grace, and it tendeth not the leaſt to Gods diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (nay, rather the weakneſs and meanneſs of the inſtrument in ſuch caſes commendeth the workman) becauſe he hath manifeſted this to be his pleaſure, <hi>it pleaſed him through the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21 He will give light to the world onely by the Sun, though he could do otherwiſe; therefore as ſome obſerve, though light were made the firſt day, yet the Sun was not made till the fourth day, to ſhew that God could give light to the world without a Sun. Thus God could convey the Spiritual light of holineſs without the Sun of ſcripture, but it is his will to make that his ordinary means. It is the word which makes clean the filthy, <hi>John</hi> 15.3. which ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the unholy, <hi>John</hi> 17.17 which beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth grace in thoſe that were graceleſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. For this cauſe it is called the <hi>ingrafted word, James</hi> 1.21. for as the Cions of a good
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170410:26"/>apple grafted into a crab-tree ſtock doth change the harſh ſowr nature of it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſweet and pleaſant, ſo the word preached (for of that he ſpeaketh, <hi>verſe</hi> 19.20.) can change the ſtony, cannal, earthly heart of man, and make it ſoft, ſpiritual and heavenly.</p>
               <p>Some have indeed been converted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as <hi>Luther, Auguſtine, Junius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers confeſs they were; but moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is by hearing, that mens ſouls come to live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. There is a bleſsing for Readers, and there may be a fiſh or two caught in the net, that is let down in an heap, but that is rare: it is not the net lapped up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but haled out at length and ſpread all abroad, that bringeth in the draught: So it is the ſpreading out the word, the dilating on the matter in hand, which uſually catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſouls</p>
               <p>The Law like <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> prepareth the way of the Lord by opening and ſearching the feſtred wounds of the finner, by making him ſenſible of his ſores, his ſins and miſery, and heartily deſire a Phyſician, a Redeemer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. then the Goſpel perfecteth the cure by pouring oil into the wounds, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up by acquainting the ſoul with, and intereſting him in the free and rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in Chriſt. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. The Law like <hi>Moſes</hi> bringeth to the borders, but the Goſpel like <hi>Joſhua</hi> leadeth into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Thus the Scriptures (as is wittily expreſsed by one)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170410:26"/>are the bells which ring all in, which call peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the Church of God. The Poets ſpeak of muſick which hath made ſtones leap into walls; this word of God hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtones into fleſh, of ſtones it hath raiſed children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Here is the formal cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, whereby God doth at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the whole man after his own image: now becauſe this is the cauſe which doth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically difference a thing, and this being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, its nature will beſt appear, I ſhall ſpeak the more to it, and obſerve in it theſe four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The act, renew, 2 The Subject, the whole man, 3 The pattern, after his own image, 4 The ſeaſon or time, at firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For the act I call it <hi>a renewing</hi> (and ſo doth the Apoſtle, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23, 24,) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a double account; partly becauſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation nature is not ruined, but recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The Convert is the ſame man but new made: The Faculties of his ſoul are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but they are refined; the ſame Viol, but new tuned. Chriſt gave not the blind man new eyes, but a new ſight to the old ones. Chriſt did not give <hi>Lazarus</hi> a new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but enlivened his old body: So God in Converſion doth not beſtow a new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but a new light to the old; nor a new Soul, but a new life to the old one. The powers of the man are like ſtreams not dryed up, but turned into another Channel.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170410:27"/>The truth is, that man by his fall from God is ſo exceedingly degenerated and polluted, that repairing and mending will not ſerve, he muſt be wholly and throughly new made, as the houſe infected with the leptoſie, ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping would not do, it muſt be pull'd down, and new ſet up, but as when an houſe pul'd down is new ſet up, we uſe poſſibly the ſame timber and ſtones, and materials which were in it before, onely they are new ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and poliſhed, what is rotten or amiſs in them is pared off, and what is wanting (as ſeverall things will be) are added: So when this new building of Regeneration is erected, the Spirit of God makes uſe of the old ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial materials (the ſoul and its faculties, the body and its members) which were in man before, onely poliſheth and purifieth them, and ſquareth them according to the rule of Gods word, it hews off what is unſound and ſinfull, and beſtoweth that grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is needfull, He taketh not away our beings, but the wickedneſs and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of our beings, and addeth a new gracious beauty which we had not before We put off the rags of the old man, and put on the Robes of the new man and continue in regard of ſubſtance the ſame men.</p>
               <p>Again, I call it a <hi>renewing,</hi> partly becauſe of the great change which is wrought in a man converted. New things differ much from old for the better. O how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170410:27"/>doth the new born ſoul differ from his former ſelf! As <hi>Saul</hi> when he received the ſpirit of courage became another man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.6. ſo doth the Chriſtian when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſpirit of grace: He is not in ſome ſenſe the ſame man he was before, he liveth a new life, he walketh in a new way, he ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his courſe by a new compaſs, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a new coaſt. His Principle is new, his Pattern is new, his Practices are new, his Projects are new, all is new: He ravels out all he had wove before, and employeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly about another work. What a change is there when the blind ſee, the deaf hear, the dumb ſpeak, the lame walk, the dead live, when the Lion is turned into a Lamb, darkneſs into light, ſickneſs into health! why all this and more is done in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, when a ſinner is changed into a Saint: It is therefore moſt fitly called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.3. which is a term borrowed from travellers, who being out of their way turn about, and ſo get into it, leaving the way in which they were, and taking ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if need be) quite contrary to it. The ſinner is born with his heart and face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fleſh, the world, and hell, and with his back towards God, holineſs and heaven, and ſo he goeth on a many years poſsibly till God convert him, and turn him about; then his back is towards the former, his face and heart towards the latter; his whole life before was a departure (every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170410:28"/>action being a ſtep) from God; his whole life now is a drawing nigh every duty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a nearer approach to God.</p>
               <p>A man and a beaſt differ much in their lives, but a natural and regenerate perſon differ far more; even as ſo far as the Spirit of God, which is the principle of a Chriſtian life differeth from the rational ſpirit of a man.</p>
               <p>Extraordinary and ſtrange things are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led new, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.22. Well may the Convert be called a new creature, the work of Converſion making ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful alteration, that carnall men admire it: <hi>They think it ſtrange that ye run not with them to the ſame exceſſe of riot,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.3, 4. nay thoſe that are thus renewed, wonder at themſelves, <hi>Being called out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. <hi>Wofull dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> makes it <hi>wonderfull light:</hi> As a man that hath been all his dayes kept in a dark priſon and never beheld the Sun, when he cometh to be ſet at liberty, and ſee the light, he ſtands amazed, wondering at it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Subject (I call it a renewing of) <hi>the whole man:</hi> As in our fiſt birth, not one part or member is born, but every one: ſo in our ſecond birth the whole man is new born. By our firſt birth the whole man is polluted, and therefore by our ſecond birth the whole man muſt be purified. Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin defileth the whole man, from the crown of the head to the ſoles of the feet; and Regeneration refineth the whole man,

The water of life within is not like a Spring which ariſeth in ſome parcel of ground, and terminateth in the ſame; but like the Ocean which compaſſeth about the whole (little) world of man: As when Gods laws were written in Tables of ſtone, <hi>The Tables w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the new creature, though every part be not throughout ſanctified, yet he is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in every part throughout; he hath a perfection of parts, though not of degrees.</p>
               <p>Regeneration like the Sun goeth through the twelve ſigns of the Zodiack; there is nothing hid from the heat thereof; it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in, and worketh upon every faculty of the ſoul and every member of the body; but the image of God is principally in the ſoul, or the <hi>inner man,</hi> Heb. 8.10.

               <p>In the ſoul I ſhall couſider, 1 The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to which the ſpirit of God makes its approach in the firſt place, inlightning it in the knowledge of ſin and the Saviour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23. The underſtanding to a man, is as a window to an houſe, which before being continually ſhut, and little light appearing, 'twas no wonder that the heart lay ſo ſlut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly, and was ſo full of the deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but now <hi>God reneweth the ſoul in knowledge, after the image of him that created him. Col.</hi> 3.10. before the god of this world had blinded the mind that it could ſee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the emptineſſe of the world, nor the preciouſneſſe of the word, nor the loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of ſin, nor the lovelineſs of the Saviour, nor the vanity of the creature, nor the excellency of the Divine nature; but whereas the man was blind before, <hi>now he ſeeth; being made ſpiritual he judgeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14.15. He judgeth the things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170410:29"/>to be far better then the things of earth, the concernments of his ſoul much more worth then the concernments of his body; and the affairs of eternity far more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the rattles and trifles of time, and all by reaſon of the new ſight beſtowed on him. Satan truly carrieth men hoodwinkt to hell, as Higlers carry their fowls in Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers to the City, where they are killed, that they cannot ſee one foot of the way, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know they whether they are going; but God doth not carry men blindfold to bliſs; but as in the old, ſo in the new creation he beginneth with light.</p>
               <p>The Undeſtanding in Regeneration is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated to ſee two things eſpecially Sin to be the greateſt evil, and God in Chriſt to be the greateſt good; and I verily beleive the miſtake of the man before about theſe two things were a principal cauſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſcarriages in his heart and life: Before he looked on ſin through the Devils ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, and beheld that ſtrumpet dreſt in her gaudy attire of pleaſure and profit, whereby ſhe was to him as the forbidden fruit to <hi>Eve, pleaſant to the eyes;</hi> But now he beholdeth ſin through the glaſs of the Law (in its oppoſition to the bleſſed God, and his own happineſs) ſtript na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of all thoſe counterfeit and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ornaments, and it is the evil of evils, ſinful ſin indeed.

He wondered what made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo much in love with him; his voyce was to a Chriſtian, <hi>What is thy Beloved more then another Beloved, that thou doſt thus follow hard after him,</hi> forſake all for him, dedicate thy ſelf wholly to him, that thou prayeſt ſo fervently, heareſt ſo diligently, ſerveſt him ſo chearfully, art ſo careful to pleaſe him, ſo fearful of offending him! he judged him happier that had plenty of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then him that had God in Chriſt for his portion; but now his mind is enlightned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, The Conſcience is alſo renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to this Faculty the Spirit makes its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs in the next place; the Conſcience of the man naturally was ſo hard and obdurate, that as ice, through the extremity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a great froſt, you might have drive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But now his Conſcience is as the water which hath ſuch a tender film of ice upon it, that yeildeth at the leaſt touch; a ſmall ſtroak of ſin maketh an impreſſion upon it; before it was <hi>ſeared with a red hot iron,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.2. and paſt feeling, <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 4 17, 18, 19. as that member which the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon intendeth to cut off is ſo mortified by means applied to it for that end, that it feeleth not the Saw or Inſtrument which parts it from the body; ſo the conſcience was by cuſtom in ſin ſo cauteriſed, that it felt not the ſword of the Spirit; neither Miniſtry, nor Miſery, nor Miracle, nor Mercy could prevail with it; but now it becomes tender and flexible, a little prick with a pin is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to it; as the eye it is offended with the ſmalleſt duſt, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.19. <hi>it is void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence towards God and man,</hi> Acts 24.16. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it (like <hi>Micaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahab</hi>) never ſpake good to the man, but frighted him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170410:31"/>with fears, and terrified him with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions of his eternal torments; it followed him to bed and board, and dog'd him day and night like a Sergeant to arreſt him, at the ſuit of the moſt High, for the vaſte debts which he owed to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. The man and his conſcience were like fire and water; they never met (if the hands of conſcience were not tied down by force) but they fought: Like ſome contentious couple they were always ſcolding one with another, and ſtriving for the maſtery: The endeavor of conſcience was as the Angel to <hi>Balaam</hi> to ſtand in the ſinners way with a drawn ſword, and ſtop him in his curſed courſe; the care of the ſinner was to ſerve conſcience as <hi>Herod</hi> did the Baptiſt, even to cut off its head, for having a tongue in it ſo bold as to check him for his crimes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. But now <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus, is purged from dead works,</hi> and ſo being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is pacified. The creditor now is ſatisfied by the payment which the ſurety hath made, and thereby the debtor is diſcharged. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience now waits on the Chriſtian, not as a Sergeant to moleſt him, but as a Servant to aſſiſt him to its utmoſt power. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and his conſcience are now like two in conſort that keep tune and time together, or as ſome loving Husbands and Wives, who ſtrive moſt which ſhall pleaſe the other beſt; Conſcience ſtrives to pleaſe the Chriſtian by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170410:31"/>asking the Law at God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s lips, and making Scripture its Counſellor; the Chriſtian ſtrives to pleaſe his conſcience by yielding hearty ſubjection to its holy counſels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rom</hi> 5.1. The renewed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence giveth the new creature more ſolid comfort in one duty, then the natural man (though he equal <hi>Methuſelah</hi>'s age) hath all his days, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Will is alſo renewed; the Will before was carnal, crooked, ſtubborn, rebellious againſt God and his will; <hi>the works of the Devil he will do,</hi> Joh. 8.44. <hi>And as for the word which thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not do it,</hi> Jer. 44.16. It is reſolved for evil and againſt good, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>John</hi> 5.40. This is Satans Fort-Royal. wherein he continually ſecures himſelf in the unregenerate, when he is in a skirmiſh beaken out of the out-works by ſome ſudden conviction; and in this, as <hi>Samſons</hi> in his hair, his whole ſtrength lieth; <hi>Take away Will, and you take away Hell.</hi> But this faculty is now made pliable and flexible to the Divine Majeſty: It is made ſo ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, regular and conſonant to the will of God, that the Convert may ſafely (if humbly) ſay with <hi>Luther, Lord, let my will be done, becauſe it is thy will:</hi> God and the godly man do now as two friends will and nill the ſame thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, 7.</p>
               <p>As the Will is a ſervant, it is now chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubject to its Maſter in heaven; its
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170410:32"/>voice is, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9.6. <hi>And, ſpeak Lord; for thy ſervant heareth,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. do but ſhew it your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King of Kings for what you require, and it preſently doth obey, not diſpute your commands.</p>
               <p>As a Maſter (for 'tis a Centurion in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which hath many at its command, it ſaith to one faculty <hi>go and it goeth; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother come and it cometh; to a third, do this, and it doth it</hi>) it ruleth now according to Divine Writ, and gives Laws to all under it, according to the Orders which it receiveth from God its Commander in chief; were the Chriſtians power but anſwerable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to his will, he would be as holy on earth, as he ſhall be in heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>The iron gate indeed of mans Will is far from opening of its own accord; the Will is hardeſt won of any Faculty; it is like the ſtrong fort of <hi>Zion</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> himſelf could not ſurpriſe; the Son of <hi>David</hi> alone can do it: But the Spirit of God doth powerfully, though ſweetly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it to chuſe God, and for God. The Underſtanding diſcovering to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the neceſſity, excellency and benefit of proclaiming and proſecuting an open and eternal war againſt all ſin, and of accepting and embracing an everlaſting covenant with God in Chriſt, and of ſubmitting to the guidance and government of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170410:32"/>conſcience doth in the name of God, whoſe Officer it is, charge the will to cloſe with theſe things; the will, (the ſpirit ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in) yieldeth contentedly, and reſolveth accordingly, <hi>God perſwades this Japhet to dwell in the tents of</hi> Shem.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Affections are likewiſe renewed: The Underſtanding and Will (the ſuperiour Officers) being won, theſe like faithfull, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldiers, readily follow their leaders, or as dutifull handmaids they obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their Maſter and Miſtris: They are called by ſome the ſhapings or formings of the will in ſeverall motions, according to the object preſented; ſo that the will like the Sun moving heavenward, theſe like Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers muſt neceſſarily follow its motion.</p>
               <p>Before theſe affections were in ſeverall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards full of corruption, but now they are purified for the Maſters uſe. Before, they were carried out towards wrong objects; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred was ſet upon God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 30. his word <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.17. and people, <hi>John</hi> 15.19. Love was beſtowed on ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.31. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. and 4. and ſin, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22. But now the man loaths what formerly he loved, and loves what formerly he loathed: though ſin were the luſcious meat, which did ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly pleaſe his pallat, that his teeth were alwayes watering after it, and he roll'd it as a ſweet morſel under his tongue; yet (now he ſerves it, as <hi>Amnon</hi> did <hi>Tamar</hi>)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170410:33"/>the hatred wherewith he hates it is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the love wherewith he loved it. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.104, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. he cannot ſee this knife with which he had cut the throat of his precious ſoul and deareſt Saviour, but his eye affects his heart with ſorrow and anger, O 'tis a killing look which he now gives his moſt beloved luſt; he cannot meet this brat of hell; this ugly gueſt in any room of the houſe, but his heart riſeth againſt it: And as hatefull as God was to him before, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5, 7. yet now he alone is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury meat which his ſoul loveth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1. and 73.25. If this diſh ſtand on his table, though all others be removed, he hath that diſh which he loveth beſt.</p>
               <p>His joy before in the creatures, is now in Chriſt, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. his ſorrow was before for ſufferings, but 'tis now for ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11. His fear was before leſt he ſhould loſe his flocks, or his friends, or outward mercies; but now 'tis leſt by ſin he ſhould loſe Gods favour, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4:6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.12, 13.</p>
               <p>His deſire was before enlarged after go'd as hell, but now 'tis after grace as heaven, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is thy name, and to the remembrance of thee,</hi> Iſa. 26.8.</p>
               <p>Before, the affections were alſo carried out inordinately after objects that were lawfull: The man was like to be drown'd in the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of lawfull enjoyments; when he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170410:33"/>in the creatures he would over-joy, and turn thereby his mirth into madneſſe, when he loved his relations he would over-love them, and change thereby his love to them into ſelf, or ſoul-hatred: ſo for his anger, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26. it would exceed its limits, even where it was lawful. For theſe paſſions of the mind are like the water of the ſea, uſefull and profitable if kept within their bounds, but if they overflow the banks they are very hurtfull, and threaten a Deluge: but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſon doth moderate and rectifie theſe affections, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29.30. He keepeth his fire ſo watchfully, that it doth not burn his houſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the affections were corrupt before, in regard of the contrariety which is in them: They did torture and tear <hi>the child of diſobedience;</hi> one drawing him one way, another plucking him the contrary way; but grace compoſeth the affections which could never agree one with another; before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion hope and fear, joy and grief, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reſolution were repugnant each to other; but regeneration makes them good friends; when the new creatures heart leaps with hope of heaven, he is then fulleſt of fear, leſt he ſhould diſpleaſe God; when he is mourning for ſin he can rejoice in his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as the heavens can ſhine and ſhown at the ſame time, he can be meek and fiery, as <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 12. humble and reſolute, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet not like <hi>Rebeckah</hi> have two
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170410:34"/>contrary Nations ſtruggling within him. The underſtanding, will and conſcience are the chief ſtrings in the ſoul, to which all the reſt are tuned; now they being by the ſpirit ſet up to their due height and holineſſe, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are wound up accordingly, and ſo make a compleat harmony of the whole, and yields a gratefull ſound in the ears of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Memory is renewed. This maſter of the Rolls, or keeper of the antient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, was formerly as a grate ſuffering the pure and clear water to go through, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining only the mud and filth; but now it is like a fan caſting away the chaff, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the good corn; it was before as a ſive letting the fine flower go through, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the bran; but now it is like the Ark wherein the two Tables are ſafely laid up. The ſanctified mans memory is a ſpirituall Treaſury: he layeth up the things of God (as <hi>Mary</hi>) in his heart, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.19. and as occaſion ſerveth bringeth them forth, and layeth them out in his life; he remembreth the commandments of God to do them, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.16.</p>
               <p>Indeed (as the reſt ſo) this faculty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed but in part; and therefore as in the beſt room a ſpider may ſet up her cobweb, in the beſt garments there will be duſt, ſo in the beſt memory there may be ſomewhat which is bad and filthy, but the cleanly Chriſtian no ſooner ſpieth it, but he ſweeps it away.</p>
               <p>This work of Regeneration doth alſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170410:34"/>reach to the body, the ſtrong Caſtle of the ſoul being taken and ſanctified, the Town of the body commanded by it preſently yieldeth. <hi>The wheels and poiſes being right within, the hand of the Dial will go right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi> When Satan ſate on the Throne of the ſoul, as King, the members of the body, (which the Holy Ghoſt termeth in unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſons <hi>weapons of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.13.) were his <hi>Militia,</hi> and employed to defend his unjuſt Title, to execute his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deſigns, to perform his helliſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the head to plot, the hands to act, the feet to run, the eyes to ſee, the ears to hear, the tongue to ſpeak for him: but as when an enemy is conquered, and a Magazine in War is taken, the General maketh uſe of thoſe Arms and of that Ammunition for his ſervice, which before were employed againſt him; ſo the ſtrong man Satan being beaten out of his ſtrong holds by Chriſt the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then he, the members of the body which before were <hi>inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, are now inſtruments of righteouſneſs unto God,</hi> Rom. 6.13, 16. The eyes which before were wanton, open, and <hi>full of adultery,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. are now lock'd down faſt with a <hi>covenant not to look after a maid,</hi> Job 31.1. <hi>They are turned away from beholding vanity,</hi> Pſal. 101.3. The ears which before were as deaf as the adder, not hearing the voice of the heavenly charmer, do now hearken to what the Lord ſpeaketh, as ſoon as the wandring
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170410:35"/>ſheep is brought home to the fold of Chriſt, he is known by his ear-mark, <hi>He heareth Chriſts voice, and followeth him,</hi> John 10.27. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 85.8. The breath and ſpeech which before were corrupt, ſtinking, as proceeding from rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lungs, an unſanctified heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. is now ſweet, ſeaſoned with grace; for the mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are ſound, Anatomiſts teach us that the heart &amp; tongue hang on one ſtring; <hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſdom, and his tongue talketh of Judgement; for the Law of God is in his heart</hi> Pſal 37.30, 31. his lips ſpeak the language of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The ſound of the mettal diſcovers it to be ſilver, <hi>His very ſpeech bewrayeth him</hi> (as they ſaid of <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 26.73.) <hi>to belong to Jeſus:</hi> His feet before made haſte to ſhed blood, they ran to evil, were the Devils Laquey to go on his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.16. but now they are <hi>turned to Gods teſtimonies,</hi> they run the <hi>way of Gods Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.1, 59 His hands before were full of oppreſſion, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, bribery and extortion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.17. Satans ſervants to make up that work which he cut out but now, they are lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Gods Law and word: thus in their places are all the faculties of the ſoul and members of the body Obedients to Gods Precepts, and ſerviceable to his Will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I obſerve in this formal cauſe, the pattern; it is a renewing of the whole man <hi>after the image of God;</hi> Mans loſs and miſery by his fall conſiſteth in theſe two
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170410:35"/>things. 1. He loſt Gods image and likeneſs. 2. Gods favour and love: Now that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> might recover us to Gods love, he doth imprint on us Gods image; for like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the ground of love. Therefore the regnerate are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. and <hi>the new man</hi> which they put on in converſion is ſaid <hi>to be after God,</hi> and <hi>after the image of him that created them,</hi> Epheſ 4.23. Col 3.10. <hi>The Law of God is written in their hearts,</hi> Heb. 8.10. which Law is nothing but a conformity, or likeneſs to the nature and will of the Lord. The corrupt image of Satan and the old <hi>Adam</hi> is defaced, therefore it's called <hi>a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the old man,</hi> Col. 3.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. the pure image of God is introduced, therefore its called <hi>a putting on the new man,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24. <hi>which after God is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true holineſs,</hi> and <hi>a being holy as God is holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16. And indeed all theſe new born children do ſo far as they are regenerate compleatly reſemble their father: Their godlineſs is nothing but God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſs, a beam of the divine glory, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Gods own perfections: As the wax bears the image of the ſeal, and the glaſs of the face, ſo doth the new creature bear the image of his Creator. <hi>David</hi> was a man after <hi>Gods own heart,</hi> becauſe a man in ſome meaſure after <hi>Gods own holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, I obſerve in this formal cauſe the ſeaſon, I ſay it is a work of Gods Spirit,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170410:36"/>whereby he doth <hi>at firſt</hi> renew the whole man after his own image. Theſe words <hi>at firſt,</hi> do diſtinguiſh regeneration from Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Sanctification is a conſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive renewing of the whole man, whereby the new creature doth daily more and more dye unto ſin and live unto God: Regeneration is the birth, Sanctification is the growth of this Babe of Grace: In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation the Sun of holineſs riſes, in San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification it keepeth its courſe, and ſhineth brighter and brighter unto the perfect day, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18. The former is a ſpecifical change from Nature to Grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a gradual change from one degree of grace to another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.7. whereby the Chriſtian goeth from ſtrength to ſtrength till he appear before God in <hi>Sion.</hi> As Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Preſervation differ, ſo do Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Sanctification; Creation is the production of ſomething out of nothing; preſervation is a continued Creation, or Creation every moment in a new edition: Converſion is a new Creation, 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>The making of new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs:</hi> Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a continued Converſion, or converſion every moment, in a newer and more correct edition. Thus much for the formal cauſe of Regeneration, <hi>A renewing of the whole man at firſt after Gods image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Here is in the definition the Final cauſes of Regeneration, <hi>The glory of God,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170410:36"/>and the ſalvation of his elect.</hi> The firſt is the more, the other the leſs principal end. They are both joyned together in God's decree and intention, and in the Saints calling, and the execution of his decree. <hi>The Lord made all things for himſelf,</hi> Prov. 16.4. but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the new creation that being his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterpiece and choyce work, is particularly deſigned for the credit of the Workman; <hi>All thy works ſhall praiſe thee, O God; and the Saints ſhall bleſs thee,</hi> Pſal. 145.10. All Gods works do praiſe him, even the earth, and heavens, and bruits analogically after a manner, by ſerving him in their places and ſtations, and giving others matter and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of praiſing him. Sinners may praiſe him formally after their maner, as Trumpets make a loud noiſe, but are filled only with wind; but Saints only can praiſe him properly after his manner, in ſuch a way as he accepteth; praiſe is the higheſt, the moſt excellent part of Divine Worſhip; <hi>Now excellent speech becometh not a fool,</hi> Pro. 17.7. as every ſinner is; <hi>But praiſe is comely for the upright, Pſ.</hi> 33.1. The water of Saints praiſes is drawn out of a deep ſpring, the heart, and ſo it is ſweet and pleaſant This is God's great end in ſowing the precious ſeed of grace, that he might reap a crop of glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.14. <hi>God did at firſt viſit the Gentiles, and take out of thim</hi> (mark!) <hi>a people for his name.</hi> He makes them partakers of his Nature, that they might be a people for his name. So
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170410:37"/>
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. <hi>This people have I formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi> God formed all the people in the world for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for his own praiſe; Even a <hi>Pharoah</hi> is created and advanced that God might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17. But this regenerated people is <hi>the people,</hi> which God principally deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his own praiſe. <hi>This people I have formed for my ſelf;</hi> other people I have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by like old pieces of mettal, leaving them in their duſt and ruſt; but <hi>this people</hi> I have thrown into the fire of my Word, have caſt them anew, and made them veſſels of gold, meet for my own ſervice and glory. <hi>They ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe:</hi> They; Alas others may praiſe him ignorantly, as the arrow hiteth the mark, but knoweth not its own motion; or forcedly, as he ſqueezeth confeſſions from them of his Juſtice and ſtrength when they are under the rod or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wrack, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.27. And this is no thank to the Will of man, but to the power of God who like the Huntſman uſeth the rage of the dogs to his own end, and maketh the wrath of man to praiſe him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.10. or at beſt they praiſe him but notionally, and by hear-ſay, as one born blind may commend the Sun, or a ſtranger the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey he never ſaw. How far ſhort muſt theſe come, when no creature can do God right, or limb out his vaſt perfections in their ſeveral dimenſions! ſurely theſe muſt do him wrong, and blot his name with the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170410:37"/>moſt curious penſil of their moſt ſtudied praiſes; but <hi>this people ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe. Alexander</hi> would have none draw his picture but <hi>Apelles,</hi> or cut his ſtatue but <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yſippus,</hi> becauſe none elſe had art e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do it well. Certain it is, none have skil and wiſdom to ſhew forth God's praiſe, but that people which he formed for that purpoſe: This people which have felt the weight of their ſins, and ſmarted with wounds in their ſouls; this people, which have ſometime been terrified under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of my unſpeakable fury, and the expectation of the unquenchable fire; this people, that have ſeen their corruptions in their colours, ſuffered divine terrors, given themſelves over for dead, damned creatures, and then were by bottomleſs mercy drawn out of the depth of miſery, tranſlated out of death and darkneſs into the Kingdom of light and life; this people which I have purchaſed with the blood of my Son, beautified with the graces of my Spirit, intereſſed in rich promiſes, entitled to the heavenly poſſeſſion; this people which have been carried like the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> into the temple, 2 <hi>King</hi> 20.12. and ſeen all the richneſs and glory thereof, the pleaſures and comforts therein, taſting me to be gracious, ſitting under my ſhadow with great delight, ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their ſouls with the means of grace, and rejoycing in hope of eternal glory; this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170410:38"/>people ſhall praiſe the greatneſs of my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the manifoldneſs of my Wiſdom, the ſweetneſs of my Love, the ſureneſs of my Word, the riches of my Mercy, the freeneſs of my Grace, the beauty of my Image, the preciouſneſs of my Chriſt, and all this upon their own knowledge and experience. O the Hoſannah's, and Halelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs, the praiſe, and glory, and honor, and thanks which this people ſhall give to the Lord, and to the Lamb for ever! The harps of Saints are tuned to theſe ſongs on earth, but who can conceive what raviſhing muſick they will make in running diviſion on theſe ſeveral notes in heaven! Surely, ſurely, the greateſt revenues of praiſes which come into Gods Exchequer, are from the hearty accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of his ſanctified and ſaved ones; as they receive the choyceſt mercies, the love of God, the blood of Chriſt, pardon, peace, grace, glory, ſo they return the higheſt praiſes.</p>
               <p>The building of mans body is ſo ſtately a ſtructure, the rooms in it ſo curious, the hangings and furniture ſo rich and coſtly, <hi>embroidered as with needlework,</hi> that the owner of the houſe hath a conſiderable rent of honor paid for it: <hi>I will praiſe thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, for I am fearfully and wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made; my ſubſtance was not hid from thee, when I was made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt part of the earth, Pſa.</hi> 139.14, 15. The ſetting up of the new creation, as it is more glorious, the image of God's own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170410:38"/>(though it be imperfect in this life) the heart of a Saint being beſpangled like the heavens, with thoſe gliſtering ſtars of graces, and his life being a legible comment on the divine Law, ſo it brings the author a larger income of honor. <hi>This is the Lords doings, and it is marvellous in the godly mans eye,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13, 14, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. but when <hi>the good work now begun ſhall be finiſhed,</hi> then Gods praiſes ſhall be perfected: when the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this ſpiritual Temple is laid in this world, they cry <hi>grace, graces;</hi> but when the top-ſtone ſhall be laid in the other world, then they ſhall cry <hi>Glory, Glory; Bleſſed are they that dwell in that houſe, they ever praiſe him: in that Temple doth every one ſpeak of his glory.</hi> Therefore the Pſalmiſt obſerveth that <hi>when the Lord ſhall build up Sion, then he ſhall appear in his glory,</hi> Pſal. 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.6. While his Church is building, he is glorious; but as the Sun under a cloud, not appearing ſo to the beholders, we can ſee but little of his infinite beauty, becauſe of our weak eyes, and receive but little of his infinite bounty, becauſe of our narrow hearts; but when <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall be built up in heaven, our eyes ſhall be ſtrengthned to <hi>ſee the King in his glory, to ſee him as he is,</hi> and the water-pots of our ſouls enlarged and filled up to the brim, with <hi>thoſe ſtreams which make glad the City of God; then the Lord ſhall appear in his glory,</hi> then he ſhall have the honor of all his Attributes, the praiſe of all his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170410:39"/>and the glory of all his Perfections; for then he ſhall appear in all his royalty, embroidery, magnificence and glory. When the Saints ſhall have ſailed in the veſſel of their Saviour, through the boiſterous waters of Mens wrath, Devils rage, and the Laws curſe, and be ſafely landed in Heaven, then God ſhall have his full price of honor and glory for their fraught</p>
               <p>The other end of Regeneration, namely, The ſalvation of the Elect, is purpoſely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted here, becauſe it will be fully ſpoken to in the next Head, the firſt Reaſon of the Doctine. So much for the deſcription of Regeneration.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="reasons">
               <head>In the next place I ſhall ſpeak to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why there is a neceſſity of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in every man that would obtain Salvation.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, Becauſe every man muſt be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for (before he can be admitted into) that holy place. We ſay in Philoſophy, Nature doth nothing <hi>per ſaltum;</hi> the ground is prepared for an harveſt, by being dunged, ploughed, and ſowed; it is as true in this point of Divinity; the god of Nature will not ſave a man <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> not remove a ſwine out of a Stie immediately into a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-room, not take a ſinner reeking in his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170410:39"/>luſts, and preſenly inveſt him with a Crown of life; no, the man muſt be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Regeneration or holineſs in part, for ſalvation or holineſs which is perfect. The heathen King would not admit Virgins to his bed till they had been purified, <hi>Eſther</hi> 2.12. and ſurely the King of Kings will not receive any into his neareſt and deareſt embraces, till they are <hi>cleanſed from all pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions both of fleſh and ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every man by his firſt birth is polluted, meer darkneſs, not receiving the things of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. meer hardneſs, as unable as a ſtone to move in the wayes of God. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, wholly captivated under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin and Satan, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is unprepared for that holy place. The moſt godly father begetteth an ungodly child, <hi>Adam begat a ſon after his own</hi> (not Gods) <hi>image, Gen.</hi> 5.3. The white <hi>Halegens</hi> hatch black young ones. Though the Wheat be threſhed, fanned and parted from the ſtraw and chaff, yet when ſowed, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth Wheat both with ſtalk and husk. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> John 3.5. <hi>now fleſh and blood</hi> (eſpecially in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved ſenſe) <hi>cannot inherit the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
               <p>A raker in Privies is not fit for a Kings preſence, but Regeneration prepareth the ſoul (by purifying it) for heaven, it maketh the creature meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. We ſcald and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170410:40"/>ſeaſon veſſels with hot water, and thereby fit and prepare them to hold wine, or ſome precious liquour: ſo God ſeaſoneth the ſoul with grace, and thereby prepareth it for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Grace and glory differ not ſpecifically, but gradually grace is <hi>aetas infantilis gloriae,</hi> as learned <hi>Davenant</hi> calleth it the infancy of glory. Glory is the maturity or full growth of grace the ſame ſtate is an higher ſtature: grace is glory inchoate, glory is grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate; therefore as cloaths by lighter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are fitted to receive a deep ſcarlet die, ſo Chriſtians by grace or Regeneration are prepared for glory and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Grammar teacheth the Scholar to conſtrue and pierce, and that fitteth him in time for the Vniverſity. Regeneration teacheth the Chriſtian, what mediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God meaneth, and that fitteth for immediate Communion. Regeneration makes us capable of the beatifical viſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. not as a meer condition, but as a neceſſary diſpoſition in the agent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its object, as the ſenſitive faculties are required to the act of ſenſation, as well as ſenſible objects.</p>
               <p>And indeed heaven would not be heaven, that is, a place of happineſs to them which are not fitted for it by holineſs. We ſay of men brought up in the Countrey, that they would not delight in the honours and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a Court, becauſe ſuch things would neither ſuit their education or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170410:40"/>ſo men who know no other heaven, then to eat and drink, and ſleep, and roar, and revel, and like ſwine to wallow in the mire of ſenſual luſts, would never delight in that place of Spiritual and Angelical pleaſures; for it would ſuit neither their ſinful breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor ſenſual natures. If their ſore eyes which are continually running with a thume of corruption, cannot without pain behold the ſtar-light of holineſs in the Saints, how can they with any delight ſee God face to face, and behold that bleſſed Sun in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal noontide of purity and glory: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as they that are to live in another Countrey are fitted for it by learning the Language, Cuſtomes and Carriage of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that Countrey: So God will have them who are to live in the heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey learn before hand the work of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens there, namely, how to pleaſe, praiſe, glorifie and enjoy his Majeſty,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Every man muſt be regenerated, or he cannot be ſaved, becauſe all that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain heaven muſt be intereſted in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of heaven: Thoſe that go to that place muſt be united to, and have a part in him that laid down the price; though man may be a poſſeſſour of heaven, yet Chriſt alone was the purchaſer of it. <hi>We have boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus,</hi> Heb. 10, 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> He alone is the <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder reaching from earth to heaven, by the help of which the Chriſtian
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170410:41"/>may aſcend thither; all other deeds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance will be found forged, and all claims made to the undefiled inheritance which are not under him, are falſe (therefore hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is called the <hi>purchaſed poſſeſſion, Eph.</hi> 1.14. becauſe bought with the precious blood of Chriſt) for till a mans perſon be juſtified it can never be glorified: the guilt of ſin muſt be removed, or the ſinner cannot be ſaved; the ſoul muſt be reconciled to God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as righteous in his Son, or it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dwell with God, and be made glorious as his Son.</p>
               <p>There are two changes indiſpenſably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in all that would be ſaved, The one is the change of a mans ſtate, or a moral change, when of a bondman to ſin and Satan he is made a freeman, <hi>John</hi> 8.36. when of a ſlave to the Devil, he is made the Son of God; when he is brought from under the covenant of works to be under the covenant of grace; when of an enemy to God he is <hi>reconciled to him by the death of his Son;</hi> when though he were <hi>far off, he is made nigh;</hi> though he was <hi>not beloved,</hi> yet now is <hi>beloved;</hi> though he was a <hi>child of wrath,</hi> is now a <hi>veſſel of mercy,</hi> John 1.12. Rom. 5.10. Eph. 2.3. Rom. 9.23. 1 Pet. 2.9, 10. The other is the change of a mans nature, or a Phyſical change, when the whole man is renewed after the image of God. The former is relative, this is real; the former is the change of his condition, this of his diſpoſition; the former change is wrought
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170410:41"/>in Juſtification, this in Regeneration; now the change of a mans nature is abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe till this be wrought there is no change of a mans ſtate; the perſon is unjuſtified while the nature's unſanctified: For though Chriſt be the purchaſer of the pardon of ſin, of peace with God, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in grace, of an inheritance in glory, yet it is only for thoſe that are in him, that is, really united to him <hi>There is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. A Virgin hath no right at all to the honors and treaſures of a man (notwithſtanding ſome well wiſhes towards him) till ſhe be married to him, and become one fleſh with him; ſo a Chriſtian hath no right at all to the great and good things which are Chriſts, till he be married to the Lord Jeſus, and become one Spirit with him: Union is the ground of communion; probably when the flood came, many hung about the Ark, but the waves quickly waſht them off, thoſe onely that were in the Ark were ſaved; thus all that hang only about Chriſt, the true Ark, by a general profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be drowned, will be damned when the deluge of wrath cometh; they only that are in him by a real implantation ſhall be ſaved. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and obſerve it Reader, <hi>if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. Therefore regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is required, becauſe by it the creature is planted into Chriſt; Regeneration cutteth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170410:42"/>the man off from his own ſtock, and graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him into the Lord Jeſus; Regeneration troweth the ſiner off from his own bottom, and builds him on the Saviour, as a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Regeneration is as it were the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter which marrieth Chriſt and the ſoul together, therein the ſoul giveth it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly to Chriſt, and Chriſt giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf really to the ſoul; and thereby the ſins and weakneſſes of the ſoul, the Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Husbands; and the riches, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the home, and heaven of Chriſt, the Husbands, become the Wives.</p>
               <p>When God converteth a ſinner, he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Meſſenger (as <hi>Abraham</hi> his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard) to provide a Wife for his only Son; the Miniſter, like the ſervant with <hi>Rebeckah,</hi> treateth with the ſoul, telling it how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely bleſſed his Maſters Son is, how rich, even <hi>the heir of all things;</hi> how beautiful, even <hi>the faireſt of ten thouſands,</hi> and <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely,</hi> how exceedingly this marriage will be for its advantage; upon this (the Spirit ſtriking in) the ſoul conſenteth to take Chriſt for its Lord, and Husband, and ſo becometh the Spouſe of the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and hath heaven entailed on it for a Joynture.</p>

There are four gates through which all muſt go that get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> every one of which is ſhut, lockt, bar'd, and bolted againſt thee.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They that get to heaven muſt go through the gate of Election. As all that were not reckoned by Genealogy, were put by the Prieſthood, as being polluted, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.62. ſo all are excluded eternal life, whoſe names are not written in the Lambs book of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. <hi>ult. Whoſoever was not found
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170410:43"/>written in the book of life, was caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> Now this gate of Election is ſhut againſt prophaneſs; thou haſt not the leaſt ground to imagine that thou art elected whilſt thou art unconverted, becauſe God decreed all them to be ſanctified, whom he decreed to be ſaved; Mark that, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Who hath choſen us to ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> The end and the way were both in Gods thoughts together. Thoſe whoſe names are regiſtred in heaven, their natures are regenerated on earth. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called,</hi> Rom. 8.30. The firſt riſe (ſaith one) and ſpring of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is Election, which breaketh out by effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Calling, and ſo floweth down in the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of Faith and Holineſs, till it loſe it ſelf in the ocean of glory. Vocation is the outward expreſſion of God's inward inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſave a ſinner, or the firſt impreſſion of the ſeal upon the wax; therefore Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Vocation are both conjoyned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. nay, the one is put for the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27. becauſe they are inſeparable companions; ſo that if thy name be written in the book of life, thy nature would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to live a ſpiritual life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. Therefore (Reader) if ever thou reacheſt heaven in this eſtate of unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thou muſt make a blot not onely in the Bible, but in the very Book of Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:170410:44"/> 2. All that get to heaven muſt go through the gate of Chriſts Paſſion; <hi>There is no name under heaven given among men by which we may be ſaved, but the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 4.12. And it is the death of Chriſt which purchaſeth eternal life for Chriſtians; as the ſown ſeed by dying bringeth forth a plentiful increaſe, ſo Chriſt by dying <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many Sons to glory,</hi> Joh. 12.24. Heb. 2.10. but this gate is ſhut againſt thee; for thoſe for whom Chriſt purchaſed glory, for them he purchaſed grace. The Son of God laid down the ſame price for both; ſo that if ever he deliver thee from the condemning power of ſin, he will deliver thee from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power of ſin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people zealous of good works;</hi> ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.71, 72, 74, 75. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26. <hi>He gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> for his Church (obſerve the end) <hi>that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it.</hi> He died for ſin, that all his might dye to ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. he poured out his heart blood, that God might power down his holy Spirit. <hi>His name is called Jeſus becauſe he ſaveth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſins,</hi> Matth. 1.21. not only from the puniſhment, but alſo from the power of their ſins. Now canſt thou think (O Atheiſt!) to make Chriſt an half Saviour, as the Papiſts do, a Purchaſer of pardon, but not of purity! then queſtionleſs thou canſt be but half ſaved, and have the greateſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170410:44"/>part of thy miſery ſtill upon thee, to wit, thy ſlavery to ſin. But ſurely thou canſt not think, that when Juſtification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are joyn'd together in the purpoſe of the Father, and the purchaſe of the Son, it ſhall be in thy power to part them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>A third gate through which all muſt go that get to heaven is the gate of Scripture. The Promiſes are the gracious deeds and evidences which Saints have to ſhew for their right to that glorious inheritance: And it is curſed preſumption to expect heaven without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Now God hath in (many places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thee, but in) no place promiſed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thee. Look from the beginning to the end of the Bible, and thou ſhalt not finde one good word ſpoken to thee; there are woes and curſes, threatnings and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which thou mayſt challenge as thy part and portion, but no promiſe or ſaving bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>All the promiſes of ſalvation are condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. &amp; 11.28. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. yea including and expreſſing this very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of converſion. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that your ſins may be blotted out, Act.</hi> 3.19. the body and ſoul do ſpecifically conſtitute the whole new man, and upon thoſe two hinges of Faith and Repentance do all the ſaving promiſes in the Bible hang; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy expectance of the benefit of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170410:45"/>promiſe without the performance of the condition is ſoul-damning deluſion; Thou mayeſt like a dog ſnatch at the children bread, the Promiſes, but aſſure thy ſelf <hi>thou haſt no part nor lot in theſe matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, Reader, is the difference betwixt preſuming and believing; he that believeth, finding in his own ſoul the conditions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the promiſes of eternal life, (as namely, that he walks after the ſpirit, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth the deeds of the fleſh, hath his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. and the like) relieth on Chriſt for pardon and life, upon the warrant and ſecurity of his word and promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.114.145. He that preſumeth, looketh that God ſhould perform his part of the promiſe in giving ſalvation, but never mindeth whether he perform his part of the promiſe, in obſerving the condition. Let thy conſcience be judge whether thou art not ſuch a preſumtuous perſon, and therefore doeſt in vain look for the fruit of the promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All that get to heaven muſt go through the gate of mediate communion; heaven muſt be nigh thee before thou canſt be in heaven; it is fellowſhip with God in this world which fitteth for fellowſhip with God in the other world; <hi>without holineſs none ſhall ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. becauſe without holineſs none can ſee God, an unholy mind cannot behold him, an unholy will cannot enjoy him, unholy affections cannot delight
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170410:45"/>in him, an unholy man in heaven could not finde it a place of happineſs, for 'tis not a Turkiſh Paradice, but a place of holy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; 'tis mediate communion which doth capacitate the ſoul for immediate communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as the weaker eyes may behold the Sun in its beams, then in its glorious body at the higheſt in a clear day; ſo a ſmaller degree of holineſs will enable the ſoul to ſee God in the glaſs of his ordinances, then to ſee him face to face. Now thou canſt not enjoy him in this imperfect degree, much leſs in a ſtate of perfection, <hi>If thou ſayeſt that thou haſt fellowſhip with him and walkeſt in darkneſs thou lieſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.6. Mark, If thou ſayeſt that thou enjoyeſt fellowſhip with God, and leadeſt a ſinfull life, thou telleſt a broad lye; all that enjoy the Ordinances of God, do not enjoy the God of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; all that go to Church, do not meet with Chriſt: <hi>What cummunion hath light with darkneſs, or Chriſt with Belial?</hi> truly no more hath God with thy ſoul. Princes are not ſo prodigal of their intimate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and favour, as to throw them away upon their foes. Thy carnal minde is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity againſt God; God is a profeſt enemy to thee, and therefore can they ever walk together till they be agreed? now there is a neceſſity of walking with him before thou canſt be tranſlated to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.21. or elſe thou haſt found out a nearer way to heaven then the children of God went in.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:170410:46"/>
                  <p> Beſides, the Scripture ſpeaketh plainly, that he who hath a true hope of heaven <hi>doth purifie himſelf as God is pure,</hi> 1 John 3.3. True hope begetteth and increaſeth holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; now doth thy hope cauſe thee to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy ſelf, when like an infant thou pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteſt thy ſelf, lieſt contentedly in thy filth and never mindeſt cleanſing?</p>
                  <p>Now tell me, Reader, whether thou doeſt not ſadly cozen thy ſelf, in dreaming of ſalvation without regeneration, when God predeſtinated all to be conformable to the image of his Son in purity, whom he predeſtinated to be conformable to the image of his Son in glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. when Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered not onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure pardon, but for all his, freedom from the power of ſin; when the promiſes of the Goſpel do expreſs regeneration as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable qualification of all that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19 and when thou art ſo far from being capable of immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion hereafter, that it is impoſſible that thou ſhouldeſt in thy carnal eſtate have mediate communion with him here; canſt thou continue in thy thoughts that heaven ſhall be open to thee, when the hand of Almighty God hath ſhut it againſt thee, and blocked up every way which leads to it to keep the out? and how deceitfull and deſperately wicked is thy heart to promiſe thee (if thou wilt ſerve ſin and the world) the beautifull <hi>Rachel</hi> of heaven, when after
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170410:46"/>all thy ſlavery to thy luſts, thou ſhalt be put off with the blear-eyed <hi>Leah</hi> of Hell. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, O Reader, The wicked one, if thou loveſt the life of thy ſoul; he may by his lying ſpirit in thy heart, as ſometimes in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs</hi> falſe prophets, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee to go on in thy ſinfull courſes, and promiſe thee as he did <hi>Ahab</hi> that thou ſhalt proſper; but if thou doeſt not periſh if thou followeſt ſuch counſel, the Lord hath not ſpoken in his Word. I tell thee man, God hath no birthrights for ſuch prophane <hi>Eſaus,</hi> nor inheritances for ſuch ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmaels; Depart from me,</hi> will be the doom of all that <hi>are workers of iniquity,</hi> Matth. 7.23. <hi>into heaven can in no wiſe enter any thing that is unclean,</hi> Rev. 21.27. The earth may bear ſuch wicked ones a while, though not without groans to be eaſed of ſuch burdens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. but heaven will never be peſtred with them.</p>
                  <p>If thou didſt travel towards the Weſt, thy reaſon would tell thee, there was no poſſibility of arriving at the Eaſt, without turning about; yet thou goeſt in the broad way to deſtruction, and thy religion bids thee to expect heaven without converſion. Well! ſee what God ſaith to thee, and be confident that what he ſpeaketh he will do, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. <hi>And it come to paſs when he heareth the word of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace though I walk in the imaginations of my heart,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170410:47"/>to add drunkenneſs to thirſt, the Lord will not ſpare him, but the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this book ſhall lye upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under heaven</hi> O look to it, Friend, before it be too late; otherwiſe this work of preſumption will ſplit thee eternally; for Chriſt himſelf hath ſaid, that <hi>Except thou art born again, thou ſhall never ſee the kingdom of God.</hi>

As the ſame earth is in ſome plants bitter, in others ſweet, in both earthly; ſo the ſame humane nature may be in ſome more pleaſing, in others more poiſonous, in both but humane, neither being partaker of the Divine nature: Some are like ſwine in a fair meadow, more cleanly; others wallowing in the mire more dirty; and both ſwine. Our Civil Law ſaith of mixt beaſts, Elephants and Camels, that they do the work of tame beaſts, but have the nature of wilde ones: Such are our meer civil men; their nature is wilde, though their actions are tame.

He that went to make his picture ſtand alone, ſaw at laſt his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and cried out, <hi>Deeſt aliquid intus,</hi> there is ſomething wanting within, he meant life; ſo it may be in thee. Believe it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170410:49"/>there is a vaſt difference betwixt reſtraining and renewing grace; the former may skin over and cover the loathſom ſore of ſin, when the latter doth ſearch and cure it, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility like a black patch doth hide the wound, but ſanctity like a plaiſter doth both hide and heal it.</hi> It is poſſible that thou doſt not outwardly abound with the ſame corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which others do, becauſe thou haſt not the ſame temptations: Thy heart may be a veſſel full of poiſonous liquor, which may remain undiſcovered till thou haſt a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to broach it. Thy luſts may be as great Rebels againſt God, though they lie lurking in the ſecret trenches of thy heart, and dare not for fear or ſhame appear in the open field of thy life.</p>
                  <p>Thy Civility is a mercy, and thou art bound to bleſs God for it. But Oh take heed of truſting to it as a ſure evidence of thy good eſtate; for certainly it proveth not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a more neat and cleanly way to endleſs and eaſeleſs wo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A glorious Profeſſion</hi> is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible evidence of thy right to life. It is good to profeſs Chriſtianity: Religion is ſo noble, ſo bountiful a Maſter that none need be afraid to be counted her ſervant. We muſt confeſs Chriſt before men, if we would have Chriſt to confeſs us before his Father and the holy Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.31. he that diſowns his colours, deſerves to be caſhiered the camp: But confeſſion of the mouth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170410:50"/>muſt be accompanied with converſion of the heart, or it will not ſave; that is but the ſhadow, this is the ſubſtance of Religion. A Chriſtian in name, and a Chriſtian in nature, do exceedingly differ. The profeſſion and the power of godlineſs differ, as leaves on a tree, and good fruit; a tree that hath fruit will have leaves; a man that hath the power will have a form of godlineſs; but as ſome trees (as the Ivie) are never without leaves, yet never bear good fruit while they live; ſo many profeſs Chriſt all their days, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring forth <hi>fruit worthy of repentance and amendment of life.</hi> Some defie the Devil with their lips, who Deifie him in their lives. There may be gaudy ſigns at the door where there is not a drop of good wine in the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Apothecaries boxes have glorious titles, even when they are altogether empty. Many Chriſtians in our days are like a curious bubble, ſmooth and ſhining without, but nothing ſave wind within; <hi>profeſſing that they know God, but in works they deny him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominable, diſobedient, and to every good work reprobrate,</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> A man may wear Chriſt's livery, and do the Devils drudgery: <hi>Judas</hi> called <hi>Jeſus</hi> Maſter, yet betrayed him. Thou mayſt, like the Jews, put a Crown on Chriſts head, a Scepter in his hand, and bow the knee to him, as if he were thy King, and yet all be but in mockery; thou mayſt crucifie and put him to death for all this, by thy ſinful ungodly life. Silver look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170410:50"/>white, and yet draweth black lines; thy profeſſion may be fair when thy practices are foul. Sin is ſo ugly that it's aſhamed of the light, and therefore <hi>walks not openly</hi> as Chriſt, <hi>for fear of the people</hi> (though for a different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from his) leſt it ſhould fright them from continuing its friends; but as a theif it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abroad in the night, and then with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and falſe beards (unwilling to be known who they are) even with a form of godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 5. An Hypocrite like a Bankrupt, the leſs ſubſtance he hath, the more ſhew he maketh. The Oſtrich hath great feathers but cannot flie. Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth him to a tomb, which is without comely, within unſavory.</p>
                  <p>Good doth not always appear with the ſame beauty, being clouded with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo evil doth ſeldom appear in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive deformity, but like <hi>Jezabel,</hi> fills up the wrinckles of its face with artificial daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery. When <hi>Abſolom</hi> intended his unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rebellion, he pretended Religion; he had a vow which he muſt pay, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.7. When <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> deſigned murder and death to the <hi>Sechemites,</hi> they hang out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for their colours; <hi>They may not marry their Siſter to one that was uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> Gen. 34.14. Thus many lead Religion about as wandring cheaters do a monſtrous woman, whom they no way affect, meerly to get money by it, for their own praiſe or profit, but do not entertain her as their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170410:51"/>Miſtris, giving her the power and keys of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>When Religion is in faſhion, many will dreſs themſelves by her Looking-glaſs; <hi>Joab</hi> himſelf, though a man of blood, will learn her language; ſee how exactly he ſpeaks in her dialect, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.13. If the Jews pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered, the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and they were kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. The riſing Sun is adored by the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi> Summer brings in not only herbs and fruits, but Butterflies and Caterpillers which feed on them, and attire themſelves with the livery of the ſeaſon: So in the proſperous eſtate of Religion many Summer birds will wait on her, and court her out of love to her portion not to her perſon; but theſe like Pirates put their veſſels into the colours of nations which they abhor, not to ſerve them faithfully, but to rob them the more eaſily. As <hi>Samballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> made ſhew to help, when their aim was to hinder the Jews. And truly ſuch a lamp or blazing profeſſion will quickly go out for want of oyl in the veſſel, this inward Regeneration. Thy rotten houſe will fall when theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly props of treaſure or honors which ſhroud it up, are taken away: Like the Moon thou mayſt ſhine brightly the former part of the night, but ſet before morning.</p>
                  <p>The Hare when ſhe is hotly purſued betakes her ſelf to ſome beaten path, not for any love ſhe hath to it, but that there by the ſcent of paſſengers ſhe may loſe her
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170410:51"/>ſcent, and take off the dogs: So many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons that have rob'd the State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſued, betake themſelves to the Church path, not for devotion, but that they might loſe the ſcent of their vileneſs, and take off their proſecutors.</p>
                  <p>Thy profeſſion, Reader, is one of the weakeſt foundations imaginable to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for thy practices may every hour give thy profeſſion the lie. The Pope profeſſeth himſelf the ſervant of ſervants, and yet even then <hi>exalteth himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.4. And he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelf ſo humble as to do ſervice to the meaneſt Chriſtian, is yet ſo proud as to take merit from Chriſt himſelf. Every one that's cloathed in black is not a Scholar, nor every one that wears a ſword a Soldier; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is every Profeſſor a true and upright believer. <hi>Pharnaces</hi> ſent a crown to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> when at the ſame time he rebelled againſt him, but <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſent back the crown, with this meſſage, <hi>Let him return to his obedience firſt, and then I will accept the Crown:</hi> Thus God will not be graced with our crowns of profeſſion, unleſs that be crowned with a gracious converſation; <hi>He is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumciſion is that in the heart, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God,</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Spiritual Priviledges</hi> are no ſure
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170410:52"/>ſign that thine eternal eſtate is ſafe; we read of them that <hi>were Iſraelites, to whom pertained the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes; whoſe were the Fathers, of whom, as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.4, 5. and yet many of them <hi>periſhed</hi> notwithſtanding all theſe great <hi>Priviledges. Paul</hi> had glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous priviledges when he was a graceleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5, 6. Thou mayſt enjoy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Sacraments, Sabbaths, ſeaſons of grace, the ſociety of Saints, and yet miſs at laſt of ſalvation. All that are in a family are not children, though they poſſibly feed at the ſame table, and lodge in the ſame chamber. All that enjoy Church-miniſtry are not Church-members; <hi>Doeg</hi> may ſet his foot within the houſe of God as far as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. Iudas</hi> may partake of the ſame privileges with the Apoſtles, and yet be a devil the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court was larger thent he inner; and ſo Gods viſible Church takes more in then his inviſible. Tares may be in the ſame field with wheat, enjoying the ſame benefit of the Sun, rain, and earth, and yet are tares ſtill. The Jews boaſted much that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, <hi>Matth</hi> 3. and yet Truth it ſelf tells them, that they were <hi>of their father the devil,</hi> Joh. 8.44. <hi>Circumciſion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature,</hi> Gal 6.15. Where the new creation is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpiritual priviledges are but as ſeals to a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170410:52"/>blank, and ſignifie little. Regeneration is the figure, which if miſſing, they as cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtand for nothing.</p>
                  <p>The voyce of many among us now, is like to the voyce of the Jews heretofore, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.3. in time of their diſtreſs; <hi>Bring us the Ark,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that that may ſave us,</hi> when alas they were deſtroyed by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines for all their Ark: So thou Reader, when conſcience frighteth thee, or death comes nigh thee, probably ſpeakeſt in thy heart, come bring me the Ark, that that may ſave me; bring me the Sacrament that ſhall ſave me, thou runneſt to thy Baptiſm, to thy Sabbath, to priviledges, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeſt that thou canſt not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when alas, thou mayſt go to hell fire for all thy Font water, and to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments though thou haſt often been at the Lords Table, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal water is not ever the laver of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; many ſit at the Lords Table, which do not taſte of his Supper. All in the Church may hear the word of Chriſt, but few hear Chriſt in his word. It is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to enjoy the Sabbath of the Lord, but not ſo to enjoy the Lord of Sabbaths. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges are of great value in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but like a jewel which ſome ſpeak of, they loſe their vertue if put into a dead mans mouth; they are of no efficacy or benefit to thy ſoul whilſt thou continueſt dead in treſpaſſes and ſin: Unregenerate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170410:53"/>
                     <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to God as <hi>Ethiopia, Amos</hi> 9.7. for all their priviledges; <hi>Gentiles</hi> regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated are called <hi>Jews, Gal.</hi> 6.16. and <hi>Jews</hi> unregenerated are called <hi>Gentiles, Amorites, Hittites, Sodomites,</hi> Ezek. 16.3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                  <p>Spiritual priviledges always commend God to us, but not us to God. Their abuſe will be a dreadful encreaſe of thy damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but their bare uſe will be a pittiful plea for ſalvation. How many live all their days under the means of Grace, that never get one dram of grace in the uſe of the means; <hi>Corazin, Bethſada</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> who had the priviledge to hear Chriſt's oracles, and to ſee his miracles, were ſad ſeals to theſe truths, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. for they were lighted to the chambers of utter darkneſs with the torches of Ordinances. Reſt not in this Reader, for thou mayſt be lifted up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the enjoyment of Priviledges, and caſt down to hell for miſ-improvement of them. Thou mayſt like the <hi>Decii</hi> leap into the gaping gulf at noon day, or like the <hi>Egyptians</hi> follow the pillar of fire into the deep and periſh; nay, which is ſaddeſt of all, as a ſhip which is ſinking, the more it is laden (though it be with ſilver and gold) the deeper it ſinketh; ſo the higher thy priviledges, if thou periſheſt the deeper thy perdition. Thou mayſt flye like <hi>Joab</hi> to the Altar of priviledges, but if thou art unregenerate, he that is greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> will pluck thee thence, or ſlay
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170410:53"/>thee there. The unſuitableneſs of thy life to the diſcoveries of his love, doth but tell him to his face, that thou art not careful to anſwer him in his matters; that thou wilt not ſerve his Son, nor worſhip the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor whom he hath ſet up, and hereby thou doſt but (notwithſtanding thy preferment) provoke him the more, and cauſe him, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the oven, to heat hell ſeven times hotter: Thy priviledges, like oyl and pitch, will make that fire to ſcald and ſcorch the more terribly. Weeds in the garden are ſooner pluckt up then weeds in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. No trees are more ſurely for the fire then thoſe which are planted in Gods own vineyard and bear not fruit.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Great Gifts and Parts</hi> will not ſpeak thy right to glory. Edifying Gifts and ſanctifying Grace do abundantly differ. Thou mayſt have a clear head, and yet an unclean heart. We read of them that were famous for gifts and parts, and infamous for prophaneſs; who might preach profitably, and yet were workers of iniquity; who had the gift of caſting out devils, and for all that were caſt to devils, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Carpenters, build an Ark to ſave others, and be drowned, be damned themſelves: They may carry a lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn which may enlighten others, while they go in the dark themſelves: Thou mayſt as a land-mark direct others in the right way, and never ſet a foot thy ſelf in it.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170410:54"/>How holily did <hi>Balaam</hi> propheſie, and yet how helliſhly did he practiſe! ſurely, like a burning-glaſs he hath fired many others by his heavenly language, yet he himſelf never fired. Many have gifts from God, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the gift of God, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. The Raven was an unclean creature, yet ſhe was ſerviceable to zealous <hi>Elijah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gifts may be in their eminency, where ſin is in its predominancy; the Toad hath a pearl (ſay ſome) in its head when the whole body is poiſonous. The Devil can ſpeak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently; <hi>We know thee, O thou art the holy one of God;</hi> and <hi>theſe are the ſervants of the moſt high God:</hi> for natural parts and gifts queſtionleſs he ſurpaſſeth all the men on earth, and yet he is a devil ſtill. The <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> hath a ſweet-ſented breath, but a rotten heart. It is poſſible to pray like a Saint, to preach like an Angel, and yet to practice like a Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The courſe of thy life will ſpeak much more for thee, then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of thy lips. Though thy gifts be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great, and thy parts never ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <hi>though thou ſpeakeſt with the tongue of men and Angels, and haſt not grace,</hi> this new birth, <hi>thou art like ſounding braſs and a tinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cymbal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thy parts may flow from Nature not from Saving-grace; men indeed, as blades, are all made of the ſame mettal, yet differ much by means of temper; ſome are more ſoft and ſmooth, more keen and ſharp;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170410:54"/>others more dull and blunt, more ſtiff and ſtuborn; for though it be confeſt the ſoul of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as created and infuſed, differeth nothing from the ſoul of <hi>Nabal,</hi> yet being to work by bodily organs, her actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her inſtruments; a man cannot make ſuch good letters with a blotting, ſcragged, as with a good pen; the better the tool is, the better the work is done with it. Some children take more after their parents then others: Though Nature hath little to give, yet ſhe deals more bountifully with ſome then with others.</p>
                  <p>Now what a groſs miſtake is this, for thee to take the crabs which grow in the common hedge-rows of Nature, to be fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as if they grew in Gods own nurſery. Knoweſt thou not that the falſe Prophets were admired by men for their parts, and abhorred by God for their impiety?</p>
                  <p>Friend, thou mayſt like the ten Spies go over the promiſed land in thy contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, view the Country, taſte the fruit, and commend it highly to others, tell them that the land is good, it floweth with milk and honey, and for all this never enjoy one foot of it. Parts and piety differ ſpecifically; gifts like the moon have ſome glimmering borrowed light, but no enlivening heat, when Grace like the Sun hath a clearer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive light, and a quickening refreſhing heat. Men indeed, like the true mother, may have the dead child of gifts put into their arms,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170410:55"/>whilſt they are aſleep in the night of this life, and think that they have the living child of grace; but when they awake in the morning of death, they will find the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For though thy gifts gliſter like glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms in the dark night of this world, yet (if ſeparated from grace) in the day of the other world they will all vaniſh, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; oh then 'twill be known that one dram of grace is more worth then a world of gifts.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly <hi>Thy ſacred performances</hi> are not a ſufficient evidence for heaven. Obſerve Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; I ſhall not condemne, nay, I do highly commend thy external obedience to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts, though thou ſhouldeſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate: becauſe few come ſo far. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> wiſhed <hi>That all were hypocrites, and that there were none but ſuch, as at leaſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Saints.</hi> It is good to wait at the Pool; Chriſt may come as he did to the Cripple, and heal thy diſeaſed ſoul. It may be as much worth as thine eternal weal, to ly as the blind man did, in Chriſts way; he may ſpeak and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſuch aſpiritual ſight in thee, as may end <hi>in ſeeing God as he is:</hi> But I am now telling thee, that 'tis ill truſting to bare duties, as ſignes of thy ſalvation; for thou mayſt mind perſonall, relative, ſecret, family, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like duties, and yet be unregenerate and periſh. He that doth not theſe things, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not good; but he that doth them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thence conclude his eſtate to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:170410:55"/>
                  <p> Thou muſt do all as to the outſide which a Saint can do, or thou canſt not be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite (for an hypocrite is the perfect picture of a godly perſon) now becauſe an hypocrite which is unregenerate, may go ſo far; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe things are not ſure ſigns of ſaving grace.</p>
                  <p>The Phariſees gave alms, made long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, faſted, and ſome of them twice in a week, and yet you know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That except our righteouſneſs exceed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, we ſhould not inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> Matth, 5.20. They were ſome (eſpecially) ſo frequent at their duties towards God, ſo righteous in their dealings with men to the eyes of others, that the Jews had a common ſaying. That if but two in the world were ſaved, the one ſhould be a Scribe, the other a Phariſee; and yet, if thou wilt believe the Lord Jeſus, he that goes not beyond them both, ſhall come ſhort of heaven: And the reaſon is plain, becauſe they were not regenerated: Their practices were ſeemingly good, but their principles really bad. The tree was corrupt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not bring forth good fruit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.17. The Iſraelites did <hi>ſeek God daily, ſaith the Prophet, they delighted to know his wayes, they asked of him the Ordinances of Juſtice, and they delighted in approaching to him,</hi> Iſa. 58.2. they there heard and prayed, and both with ſeeming delight, nay, they joyned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to prayer, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. farther, they adde
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170410:56"/>mourning to faſting, <hi>Zac.</hi> 7.4, 5. and yet all this, was but the face, the ſhell, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Religion, and thereby of no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God. If any beaſt were ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by heathens without an heart, 'twas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ominous to the perſon for whom it was offered as in the caſe of <hi>Julian:</hi> now all the ſacrifices of hypocrites, are without an heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.30.</p>
                  <p>It is recorded, that in a certain Iſland to the Southward of <hi>Celebes,</hi> night by night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the trees do ſhew themſelves ſwarms of fiery worms, which make a ſhew and give ſuch light as if all the twigs of the trees were lighted candles, and the place the ſtarry ſphere and yet all this is but an appearance; truly thus formal perſons may ſeem by their duties both lightſome and fiery, and yet be but a ſemblance and flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>Low mooriſh grounds bring forth ſome courſe graſs, but 'tis from ſprings from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, when the high meadows bring forth fine graſs, being fed with the clouds from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. The hypocrite may bring forth ſome courſe fruit, (as <hi>Egypt</hi> from the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Nilus</hi>) from the earthly ſprings, and the overflowing of a natural conſcience, which will be by no means pacified when du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are omitted; but the Regenerate man bringeth forth better fruits; like <hi>Canaan</hi> he floweth with milk and honey, being fed with the ſhowrs of heaven, and watered with the dews of Divine grace.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:170410:56"/>
                  <p> Thou mayeſt imitate the actions of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, yet be without grace; as the Ape imitateth the actions of reaſonable men, yet is without reaſon; or as a Tragedian acteth the part of a paſſionate man, but is all the while without paſſion. Some men have wrought hard at duties, when a naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened Conſcience, not God, hath been the Maſter to ſet them on work they would, but cannot neglect duties at ſo cheap a rate as others, as he ſaid, <hi>Sollicitor nullos eſſe putare deos.</hi> I could find in my heart to think there were no God, but could not: As they ſay of the Wolf in the body, if you feed not it, it will feed on you: ſo if Conſcience, when its mouth is opened, ſhould not be fed with duty, it would feed on them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to keep it from gnawing them they ſtop its mouth with performances, though they never do them from a renewed Principle. Do not therefore Reader hang the weight of thy ſoul upon ſuch weak wyers, ſince men do ſo ordinarily take the way of duties no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then <hi>Amaziah</hi> did the way of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-houſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.27. meerly for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (to eſcape an enemy that followed him) wherein he was at length purſued and ſlain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remigius,</hi> a Judge of <hi>Lorraighn,</hi> telleth us how the Devil gave ſome in thoſe parts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which at firſt appeared to be good coin, but being laid up, and when need was, taken out to be ſpent, it proved to be nothing but dry leaves. Reader, I wiſh it may not be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170410:57"/>ſo, but it is poſſible for thee to drive a great Trade in duties, while thou liveſt to hoord up a a great heap of thoſe riches, and they may ſeem to be currant coin, good ſilver, to have the image and ſtamp of the King of heaven upon it, but when thou comeſt to die, that thou art to ſpend it, for then thy works will follow thee, and God will give thee according to thy works, it may then prove but dry leaves of no worth, or profit to thee. Though theſe unſound bottoms hold out well enough in a fair ſea, when they are put to no ſtreſſe, yet ſtormy weather will quickly diſcover their rottenneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Not a few take up duties onely becauſe they were educated in ſuch a Religious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not from any relliſh or ſavour which they find in them; and truly 'twill be an eaſie matter to part him and his work, who never took any pleaſure in it.</p>
                  <p>The ſtone for a time may againſt its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be mounted upward, but when the force of that impreſt vertue which moved it is ſpent, 'twill fall downward according to its nature. Partridges that are hatched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an hen may walk with her, and anſwer her call for a time, but anon they flie away and ſhew what they are. Reader, I write not theſe things to diſhearten thee from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are the body of Religion, but to quicken thee to mind Regeneration which is the ſoul of it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The commendation of others, though
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170410:57"/>they be real Saints,</hi> will not prove thee to be in a ſtate of ſalvation. The holieſt mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of thee is a pittiful evidence that thou ſhalt be happy. How many have there been in the City who made a great noiſe, were cried up by their knowing judicious neighbors to be very rich, and to be worth thouſands, when on a ſudden we have heard of their breaking, and being worſe (as we ſay) then naught! ſo many even by them which are godly and diſcerning, may be counted rich in grace, rich towards God, and on a ſudden either by ſome temptation or at their diſſolutions they break, and God takes away from them what they ſeemed to have. How was good <hi>David</hi> miſtaken in <hi>Achitophel?</hi> Surely he thought him Gods Favourite, otherwiſe he would never have made him his familiar and boſom friend; <hi>It was thou, O man, mine equal, my friend, and my acquaintance; we took ſweet counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and walked to the houſe of God in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Pſal. 55.12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>How was <hi>Simon Peter</hi> deceived in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> who believed, wondered at the miracles which were wrought, and was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, but notwithſtanding that, was <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity!</hi> Acts 8.13, 20.</p>
                  <p>How was holy <hi>Paul</hi> miſtaken in <hi>Demas! Luke the beloved Phyſitian and Demas greet you, Coloſſ.</hi> 4.14. there he ranks him with one that was eminently religious; but <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:170410:58"/>verſ. 24. he puts him before <hi>Luke,</hi> and calls him his <hi>fellow-laborer;</hi> yet 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. (which Epiſtle was the laſt of all <hi>Pauls</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles) <hi>Demas hath forſaken me, having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this preſent world;</hi> he turned, as ſome write, Idol-prieſt, he followed the chaſe till he met with the honey, and <hi>Jonathan</hi>-like, then left the purſuit.</p>
                  <p>How much were all the holy Apoſtles deceived in <hi>Judas?</hi> If <hi>Peter,</hi> as their mouth ſpeaks of their faith, <hi>Judas</hi> is included, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.69. <hi>We believe and are ſure, that thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> When he ſpeaks of their good works, <hi>Judas</hi> is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; <hi>Behold we have forſaken all and followed thee,</hi> Matth. 19.27. Further, when a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is mentioned, <hi>Judas</hi> is not ſuſpected, his carriage was ſo fair that they were more jealous of their own hearts then of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.22. and yet he was a Traytor, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Infallibility was never annexed to the godly mans choice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dedalus</hi> made an image that moved it ſelf by art, which made the ſpectators believe that it had a living principle; the Hypocrite may walk ſo exactly, perform duties ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, that Saints may judge ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to flow from a principle of ſpiritual life. Becauſe men have the exact reſemblance of Chriſtians, therefore godly men (who are charitable abroad, and cenſorious at home) judge them to be true Chriſtians: Now in regard there may be a reſemblance of a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170410:58"/>Chriſtian in external actions, where there is not the eſſence of Chriſtianity in internal ſanctified affections; therefore they, though they ſin not, yet ſometimes they err in their judgements.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6, 7. When <hi>Samuel</hi> came to <hi>Jeſſe</hi> (being ſent to annoint a King) and ſeeth <hi>Eliab</hi> a proper handſom perſon, he preſently crieth out, <hi>Surely the Lords annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is before him;</hi> but mark what God ſaith, <hi>Look not on his countenance, nor the height of his ſtature, for I have rejected him; for God ſeeth not as man ſeeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart.</hi> So when godly men ſee their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors lovely in their lives, civil in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, high in their profeſſion, ſtrict in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, they according to their duty ſay (inwardly at leaſt) <hi>Surely the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed is before him;</hi> theſe are the bleſſed of the Lord, annointed to the Kingdom of heaven; but God may often anſwer them, Look not on their profeſſion or their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, for I ſee their hearts that they ſerve not me, but themſelves of me.</p>
                  <p>We read of <hi>Zeuxes</hi> the Painter, that he drew grapes ſo to the life that he deceived the birds, who came flying to them, and pecking at them, as if they had been real grapes. Certainly a graceleſs man may have ſuch a compleat form of godlineſs, that thoſe who are gracious cannot but judge it to be accompanied with the power, when
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170410:59"/>indeed it is but the picture. When there was a famine in <hi>Samaria,</hi> a ſcarcity of good food, the fourth part of a cab of Doves dung (which might be the quantity of a pinte) was ſold for five pieces of ſilver (twelve ſhillings ſix pence of our money) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at what an high rate that which was nothing worth was valued at in a famine; truly ſo, there is ſuch a ſcarcity of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that godly men (who exceedingly long for the advancement of Chriſt and Chriſtianity in mens hearts and houſes) prize and encourage any thing that cometh near it, that looketh like it, or hath any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency towards it; <hi>But that which is highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of men, may be abominable in the ſight of God,</hi> Luk. 16.15.</p>
                  <p>Reader, do not thou (as ſome Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) live altogether on thy credit with others. The moſt cunning takers of money that are (though they take notice of every piece) are ſometimes deceived, and take bad money (ſuch as will never endure the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone) for good coin. What a poor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort will it be to thee when thou art hungry, and naked, that others think and ſpeak that thou art fed and cloathed? he that trades highly, and lives wholly upon truſt, ſeldom holds out long; look therefore not ſo much at others commendation, but at thy own Regeneration, for that is it alone which accompanieth Salvation. It is a favour that thou doſt ſo walk as to have godly mens
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170410:59"/>good word, but for all that thou mayſt be a ſtranger to this regenerating work, and then it is not the wind of their breaths that can blow thy ſoul co the haven of bliſs.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Thy confidence of thy own good eſtate,</hi> is no infallible evidence. The world, as they are miſtaken in Repentance, taking it to be only a little ſorrow for ſin, though no averſion from it, or deteſtation of it, be joyned with it; ſo they are alſo in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Faith, eſteeming it to conſiſt in the ſtrength of perſwaſion, and that who ever can be confident that Chriſt died for him, and that he ſhall go to heaven, doth believe unto ſalvation; whereas the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a deceiving and a ſaving Faith, doth not conſiſt in the <hi>ſtrength of perſwafion,</hi> but in the <hi>ground</hi> of it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.3, <hi>ult.</hi> the two buildings might be of <hi>equal height and beauty,</hi> the difference lay in the <hi>bottom and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> An Hypocrite may ſail towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a full gale of confidence, nay the ſtrength of that wind doth over-turn the veſſel; for were he more dubious, he would be more anxious about his recovery, and ſo more likely to be ſaved. <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>that maketh himſelf rich, yet hath nothing,</hi> Prov. 13.7. That is, there are ſome that are full of confidence, rich in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that the love of God, the blood of Chriſt, the undefiled inherithnce are theirs, when indeed they have not one grain of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170410:60"/>grace, nor any true ground of their joy and peace, but are very beggars. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelf, That <hi>he was alive without the Law,</hi> Rom. 7.9. (even then when he was liable to its curſe and laſh) he had high thoughts of his preſent holineſs, and great hopes of his future happineſs, He was a <hi>jolly fellow, cock-a-hoop,</hi> taking himſelf to be <hi>ſomebody;</hi> his motto was, <hi>Omnia bene,</hi> All is well, when indeed every thing was ill, and there was but a ſtep between him and hell: he had much falſe peace, though he had no true purity; <hi>His way was right in his own eyes, but the end was the way of death,</hi> Prov. 14.12. <hi>He was alive without the Law;</hi> his ignorance was both the mother and nurſe of his confidence; juſt like a blind man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed about with bloody enemies, or in a place full of Serpents and poiſonous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet thinks himſelf ſafe becauſe he doth not ſee them. Or as a man in a Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, he feels no pain, though he be very near the pangs of death. Chriſt told the Jews, <hi>Ye ſay God is your Father, but ye have not known him:</hi> So theſe ſay, God is their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Chriſt is their Husband, Heaven their home, when they know neither.</p>
                  <p>As every wicked mans conſcience is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally evil, and ſtained with ſin, ſo many times it is naturally evil, that it doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther check him, nor judge him for his ſin. One main work of conſcience is to give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence either for or againſt a man; now
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170410:60"/>conſcience may bear falſe witneſs againſt its neighbor; the godly man, either through ignorance, or miſ-information, not judging by a right rule, or not uſing that rule right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And conſcience may give in falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony on the behalf of ungodly men, either through its blindneſs, ſleepineſs, ſecurity or ſearedneſs. Conſcience by nature doth flatter the ſinner, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. Conſcience may be ſeared, when tis not ſetled, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep when the ſinner hath no true reſt. Some men ſerve their conſciences as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> make it drunk that they may be rid of it; when it hath begun to ſtorm, they ſpeak to it by ſome carnal diverſions, as Chriſt to the rough ſea, <hi>Peace, be ſtill,</hi> and if then a calm enſue, they are ſafe. While the Devil <hi>the ſtrong man armed keep the houſe</hi> all is quiet, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence having often warned them of their ſins and miſery, and being ſtill reſiſted, at laſt grows weary, and reſolveth to give them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to their own ways and wo. Theſe men ſtrongly perſwade themſelves that all is well, and yet ſtoutly perſiſt in all that is ill, but they fall from the high turret of preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the bottomleſs gulf of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The worſt men have not ſeldome the beſt thoughts of themſelves, both as to their preſent and future eſtates. How confident was the Phariſee that his condition was ſafe for the preſent! <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. when he was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170410:61"/>in an eſtate of wrath; and what aſſurance had thoſe Prophets that they ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Paradiſe! <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21.22, 23. How boldly did they bounce at the doore, but entrance was denied, as the Jews of old ſpake peremptorily, <hi>We ſhall neither ſee ſword nor famine,</hi> though God himſelf had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told both, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12. ſo many now ſpeak preſumptuouſly, they ſhall neither ſee Laws curſe, nor Gods wrath, death nor damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when God himſelf hath enſured them to all in their conditions. <hi>They cry peace, peace, when ſudden deſolation is ready to ſeiſe on them, as travail on a woman with child, which they cannot eſcape,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.3. The mirth of theſe men was never uſher'd in by godly mourning. Their expectation is raiſed high, but its foundation is not laid low.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nero</hi> ſhut up the Temple of <hi>Janus, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam nullo reſiduobello,</hi> as if no Reliques of war remained ſaith <hi>Sueton,</hi> when at the ſame time the Empire was at Civil war with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>How ordinary is it for men whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are paſt feeling to brag that God and they are good friends (not knowing when they ever fell out) when at the ſame time he is at war with them, walks contrary to them, <hi>and is preparing for them the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of eternal death!</hi> Like <hi>Agag</hi> to the very hour of execution, they are confident of a Pardon, and go with their hearts full of hopes into the very place of deſpair.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170410:61"/>They die willingly (as they tell us) and their neighbours commend them, ſaying they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like lambs, when rather like <hi>Solomons</hi> ox, who goeth to the ſlaughter, ſo died they, going to the den of roaring Lions, and the place of Dragons. They <hi>had no Bands in their deaths who were in bondage to the devil,</hi> Pſ. 73.4.</p>
                  <p>As a man that is aſleep upon the Maſt of a Ship, he is in a golden Dream, and his thoughts upon large Revenues, rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Kingdomes and Diadems, which he hath already in his own poſſeſſion, but in that very hour wherein he is ſolacing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his vain imaginations, a ſtorm ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, the man is tumbled off the Maſt and drowned: Thus many have golden dreams, ſtrong preſumptions of their ſalvation, when alas they do but befool themſelves, are all the while upon the brink of hell, and are tumbled into it before they are aware.</p>
                  <p>Reader, look to this likewiſe, that thou build not on ſuch a weak bottome; for this may happen both to prophane men and to hypocrites. It is ſaid of <hi>Pigmalion</hi> that he drew a picture ſo lively, that he deceived himſelf, and taking the picture for a perſon fell in love with his own picture. I tell thee thou mayſt ſpin ſo fine a thread, and weave ſo curious a web of painted cloth, feigned godlineſs, that thou mayeſt deceive thy ſelf, and take it to be <hi>fine linnen, the righteouſneſs of the Saints,</hi> and mayeſt thence gather, that thy ſoul is ſafe, when in all thou doſt thou
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170410:62"/>art unſound. If confidence or not doubting our eſtates, will prove them out of danger then the ignorant, ſtupid, ſeared ſinners, muſt certainly be ſaved, which the Scriptures flatly deny. <hi>Socrates</hi> who lived according to his natural conſcience, died with much calmneſs and confidence, ſpeaking of thoſe who put him to death, that they might kill him, but could not hurt him; yet was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe name alone is ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, <hi>To follow the light within thee,</hi> or to obey the Dictates of a natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is no ſound evidence for heaven. A man may follow the light within him to the chambers of utter darkneſs. The Jeſuite in the Quaker would make this the infallible teſtimony of a mans uprightneſs and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nay, he plucks Chriſt from his Throne, and ſets the light within him in his room, making it more then a mark, even the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of ſalvation; but Reader, I ſhall clearly prove, that 'tis ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthy of our affiance, that it is not ſo much as an evidence for heaven, becauſe conſcience by nature is corrupted, as much as the other faculties. <hi>Their minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt are defiled,</hi> Tit. 1.15. The nature of conſcience is good, but the conſcience of nature is evil. <hi>It ſavours not the things of God,</hi> it is not purged with the blood of Chriſt, it is wholly blind in the matters of Chriſtianity, nay, 'tis a Rebel
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170410:62"/>againſt God. Now if I follow a blind guide, am I ever like to enter in at the ſtraight gate? Is it rational arguing that I am in my Princes favour, becauſe I obey my Captain, when he is a traytor?</p>
                  <p>I do not ſay that a natural conſcience hath no good in it, but I am ſure 'tis in the account of God an evil conſcience oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and reſiſting him.</p>
                  <p>Like an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> (as pure and perfect a light as the Quakers make it) it leadeth men out of Gods high way into thoſe bogs and quagmires wherein they ſink and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. I queſtion not, but the heathens did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their polluted conſciences in their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous practices. And ſure I am, that <hi>Paul</hi> might thank his corrupt conſcience for perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>I verily thought,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that</hi> I <hi>ought to do many things contrary to the name of Chriſt, Acts</hi> 26,9. Mark the words, they are full of weight, <hi>Pauls</hi> conſcience told him 'twas his duty to ſuppreſs Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Was not his obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of this conſcience a ſad ſign that he was to be ſaved? Further Chriſt telleth his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>That they who killed them, ſhould think they did God good ſervice.</hi> Obſerve, here was pure light within men, that made them think that they did God the greateſt ſervice in doing his Church the greateſt diſſervice. <hi>Tertul.</hi> tells us, that <hi>Maximinian</hi> the Emperor eſteemed <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum ſanguinem diis gratiſſimam eſſe victi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam:</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:170410:63"/>the blood of Chriſtians to be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifice to the gods. Is any man ſo mad, as not to think, that if ſuch a Pilot ſteer, the ſhip by anſwering to its motion muſt needs be caſt away,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> would out of conſcience have ſlain the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.2. and broken the Covenant which had been ſworn to by the Iſraelites. His conſcience was evil, and could not ſpeak his condition to be good; an evil conſcience will call bitter ſweet, darkneſs light, evil good. It will leave plain precepts, and walk by extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36.18, 19, 20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.7. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth a ſtrong impulſion of its own ſpirit before that word which is the will of Gods ſpirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36.9, 10. it eſteemeth a ſuppoſed Revelation above that Scripture which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly of Divine inſpiration, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. It placeth often moſt of its Religion in Penance, abſtinence, and outward acts of mortification, in external ſigns of humility, will-worſhip, and neglecting the body, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>ult</hi> of many of which God may ſay as to the Jews, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands,</hi> Iſa. 1.12. It makes men keep a a great ſtir about cuffs, ribbands, hatbands, (as the Phariſees about pots and cups) when their hearts are full of pride and malice, robbing even Chriſt of the glory of our redemption, and hating Chriſtians for not daring to joyn in their curſed opinion. Friend, wil following ſuch a conſcience ſpeak
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170410:63"/>thee to be a true Chriſtian!</p>
                  <p>Conſcience is indeed a rule, but <hi>regula re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulata prius quam regulans:</hi> ſuch a rule as muſt be ruled by Gods word, before it can be a right rule for our works. <hi>To the Law and to the teſtimonies,</hi> if conſcience ſpeak not according to this word, it is (becauſe there is much pretended) no true light in it. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the compaſs by which conſcience muſt bend its courſe, or elſe 'twill never land its paſſengers at the deſired haven. It is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberty of conſcience (but licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) then it is regulated by the Scripture. One office of conſcience is Magiſtratical, and Legiſlative, to command and give Laws to man. We read of the heathen, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their conſciences, <hi>They were a Law to themſelves,</hi> Rom. 2.14. <hi>Conſcientia mille Reges, mille leges:</hi> But though conſcience be a King over the other faculties; yet it is a ſubject &amp; ſubordinate to God; and therefore as a Deputy Lieutenant, it muſt command its inferiors, according to the directions which it receiveth from its ſuperiour; otherwiſe as a King which commands out of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, it is not to be obeyed. God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed given conſcience a large Commiſſion, it is a deputy Deity in the little world, man; The government of the ſoul lyeth for a great part upon its ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p>It hath an univerſal negative voice, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done without its aſſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.2. <hi>ult.</hi> but not an univerſal affirmative voice
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170410:64"/>to enjoyn what it pleaſeth; when it is regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods Law, then and not till then, it can govern well our hearts and lives.</p>

Some by their repentance think they get a new priviledge to ſin; as that <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> who would ſwear and then kiſs his crucifix; ſwear again, and kiſs it again; and as the Drunkard gives himſelf a vomit, and then he is the fitter and freer to fall to his cups again; thus ſome mens ſorrow is a meſſage ſent to heaven, to entreat leave that they may ſin; but this is far from the ſorrow which is never to be ſorrowed for.</p>
                  <p>Thy ſorrow for ſin may be forced out of thee (as water out of a ſtill) by the fire of affliction, not come freely from thee, as water out of a ſpring. Let thy conſcience be judge, hadſt thou not rather be at thy
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170410:68"/>carnal mirth, then ſpiritual mourning? Many of the Jews could mourn ſadly in their diſtreſs, though they were not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; now violent actions will not ſpeak thy natural inclination.</p>
                  <p>Or thy grief may be like a land-flood which cannot hold long; for a day thou mayſt afflict thy ſoul, for a day thou mayſt hang down thy head like a bulruſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. A bulruſh whilſt the wind bloweth bendeth downward, but the wind ceaſing it perch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up again: Whilſt thou art toſſed up and down with the boiſterous billows (as one not accuſtomed to the ocean) thou mayſt be ſea-ſick, but when thou art off from the waters thou art well again. The veſſel of thy ſoul is always leaking, but that pump of ſorrow is not always go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Thou mayſt like the woman of <hi>Tekoah, feign thy ſelf a mourner,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.2. when in truth thou art none: Thou doſt not dive to the bottom of thy heart (as the <hi>Indians</hi> at the ſea for jewels) to fetch thence thy pearly tears; thou crieſt not to God <hi>with thy heart when thou howleſt on thy bed, Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. Thy waters may not be drawn from the deep well of a broken and contrite heart: Every Sacrifice thou offereſt may be as <hi>Ephraim, a ſilly dove without an heart, Hoſ.</hi> 7.11.</p>
                  <p>Thou mayſt fear ſin, and yet ſin may be thy Favorite. The vengeance in ſins tail may be frightful to thee, when the venome
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170410:68"/>in its body and nature is not at all diſtaſteful to thee. Like the burnt child thou mayſt dread the fire of ſin, not becauſe it ſoots and blacks thee, but becauſe it ſcorches and burns thee.</p>
                  <p>There is ſo much light left ſtill in mans Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which is called the <hi>candle of the Lord,</hi> that he cannot but ſee a God, and this God cloathed with wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt ſin and ſinners, and thence he (though unconverted) may ſometime be full of fear and horror. <hi>Caligula</hi> uſed all the art he could, to blow out this light, and fortified himſelf with all the arguments he could get againſt a Deity, but could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his ends; for as often as it thundred, he was miſerably affrighted, and would run under a bed. So we read that <hi>Felix</hi> an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>trembled when Paul reaſoned of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> Act. 24.25. Sin in its doomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day dreſs, as 'tis cloathed with fire and fury, may be terrible even to the ungodly. And the conſideration of this, may make them leave many ſins, that do not loath any ſin. The Mariner throweth over-board thoſe goods in a ſtorm, which he wiſheth for, and it may be gathereth up in a calm. As a man in a feaver loveth drink, yea long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much for it, yet dares not meddle with it, becauſe 'twill make him worſe; <hi>The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Sion</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>are afraid, fearfulneſs hath taken hold on hypocrites;</hi> Why, what's the matter? <hi>Who can dwell in

Mark, it is not, Who ever abuſed ſuch an ocean of love? who ever deſpiſed ſuch a matchleſs life? who ever provoked ſuch a gracious Lord? but <hi>who can dwell in everlaſting burnings?</hi> The ſting of ſin to the unregenerate is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſting of puniſhment to the regenerate is ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.1. to fear ſin as it bringeth an heavy rod, uſually proceeds from nature; but to fear ſin, as it is a wandring from an holy rule, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed only from grace.</p>
                  <p>Truly as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> parted with his wife <hi>Michal</hi> (whom <hi>Saul</hi> had injuriouſly taken from <hi>David</hi> and given unto him) ſo unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men part with their ſins; when <hi>David</hi> came to the crown, he ſendeth for <hi>Michal, Phaltiel</hi> dares not diſobey the King, but he brings her on her way weeping, and bemoaning his loſs; he looks after her as far as <hi>Bohurim;</hi> many a ſad thought he had for her, when ſhe was by force divorced from him.</p>
                  <p>Thus unregenerate men may leave their luſts, when they are afraid to keep them, but many a longing heart they have after them, and are not by choice but conſtraint ſeparated from them. As parents, they go to the funeral of thoſe children of their corrupt hearts, with no ſmall ſorrow.

                  <p>Or poſſibly thou art entring upon ſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn act of devotion, and upon that account at preſent forbeareſt thy corruptions, as ſome write of Serpents, they lay by their poiſon when they go to drink, and afterwards take it up again.

                  <p>Reader, do not relie upon theſe affections which thou ſeeſt may be in them which are not regenerated: for as the Sorcerers ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do as much as <hi>Moſes,</hi> but did nothing in reality, ſo thou mayſt ſeem to do as much as a Chriſtian, when all is but counterfeit. Thy fear of ſin may be forced, not flow freely from thee. <hi>Fearfulneſs hath taken hold on the hypocrites.

Thou mayſt fear ſin as the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> the <hi>Jews, when the fear of the Jews fell upon them,</hi> Eſther 8.17. when the preſence of this fear, is as Chriſts preſence is to the Devils, <hi>a torment</hi> to thee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29.</p>

                  <p> Nay, thy fear may be only for a fit, like a muſhrom which groweth up in a night, and periſheth the next day. The people when they ſaw <hi>Amaſa</hi> weltring in his blood in the way, ſtood ſtill; but he being quickly removed, they went on. When thou thinkeſt of others weltring in their ſoul-blood in hell or ſeeſt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon others, thou mayſt be afraid, and ſtand ſtill a little at preſent; but theſe thoughts being ſoon removed, thou mayſt go on in the way of thine own heart.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Caſſander</hi> that he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the ſight of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Statue, when <hi>Alexander</hi> was dead, and <hi>Caſſander</hi> had gotten poſſeſſion of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> The rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man when he ſeeth with the eye of faith, the curſe of the Law, the wrath of God, the torments of hell, <hi>his fleſh trembleth for fear of them, and he is afraid of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgements,</hi> though they are all dead to him, he being <hi>not under the Law but under grace;</hi> but it may be tis the life in them, and their power to hurt thee, which makes thee afraid of them.</p>

                  <p> Reader, if thou art a civil perſon, a great Profeſſor, enjoyeſt the outward Priviledges of the Goſpel, aboundeſt in Duties and Performances, if God hath given thee gifts and parts, if godly men commend thee, and thou art ſometimes confident of thy own good condition: If thou walkeſt according to thy natural light, and joyneſt with them that fear the Lord: If ſome good affections like a flaſh of lightning, on a ſudden ſurpriſe thee (though moſt of theſe are good) yet do not hence conclude thy undoubted right to ſalvation; for all theſe may conſiſt with unregeneracy, and Chriſt telleth thee <hi>That except thou art born again, thou canſt not ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> As the Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts gold appeareth as good as the true gold, but it will not endure the ſeventh fire, nor comfort the heart as a cordial; both which the true gold will; ſo if all theſe ſhould meet in thee, they would make thee look like a Saint; but beleive it, they will never endure the fire of Scripture (which muſt ſhortly trie thee whether thou art true gold or counterfeit) nor comfort thy ſoul as a cordial when Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians ſhall give over thy body.</p>

                  <p>THirdly, If without Regeneration, none can attain ſalvation; it informeth us <hi>of the difficulty of ſalvation, that it is an hard thing to get to heaven:</hi> it is no eaſie matter to be regenerated and made holy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis no eaſie matter to be glorified and made happy. Where the gate is ſtraight, 'tis hard to get in. <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ſinner and ungodly appear!</hi> 1 Pet. 4.18. The Apoſtle there intendeth not the uncertainty, but the difficulty of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the godly. If it be ſo hard for them to be ſaved that have paſſed the Pikes, ſhot the Gulf, gone through the pangs of the new birth, and travelled a conſiderable part of their way heavenward: how hard wil it be for them who are not yet ſet out, that have not taken one ſtep in the way to life!</p>
                  <p>The ſleepy world indeed dream that men may go to heaven without ſo much adoe, they look upon civility to be ſanctity, word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſighs to be godly ſorrow, not doubting their eſtates to be faith in Chriſt; and if they can but ſpare a little time and now then from the world, &amp; the fleſh to mumble over a few night Petitions, they hope with the help of theſe bladders to ſwim through the Ocean of Divine fury to heaven. Or if they come ſhort of theſe fig-leaves (wherewith many of <hi>Adams</hi> children endeavour, though in vain to cover their nakedneſs) yet if they have the warning-piece of ſickneſs, before the murdering piece of death be ſhot off, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170410:71"/>they can but cry Lord have mercy upon us, or tell their neighbours that they are ſorry for their ſins, or get a Miniſter to pray with them, then all muſt be well, and they muſt as ſure go (when they die) to God and Chriſt, as they lived to the fleſh and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. But ſtay friends, a little, there are more words then one to this ſpiritual bargain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and your ſouls; there is a work of Regeneration to be done, or elſe ye are undone eternally; ye muſt be throughly and univerſally new made, or elſe ye are mar'd for ever. Chriſt would never have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded men <hi>to ſtrive</hi> as to an agony, <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the ſtraight gate,</hi> Matth. 7.13. <hi>to work out their ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>To labour for the food which endureth to everlaſting life. John</hi> 6.27. If it had been ſuch an eaſie thing to have reached heaven. Things of ſuch excellency are not obtained with ſuch facility. Pebbles lie common, but pearls are hardly come by. They muſt trravel far, dig deep, work hard, that will get the golden mines. The way to hell lyeth down hill, a weak body may run down hill, but 'tis hard to go up hill <hi>to Mount Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Friend, I write not theſe things to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage (alas I need not, there is not a ſtraw in the way to heaven, but thou if unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtumbleſt at it, when thou canſt leap over blocks in the way to hell) but to awaken thee out of thy carnal ſecurity, and to quicken thee to ſeriouſneſs and induſtry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170410:72"/>that which is of ſuch unſpeakable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to thy ſoul; Our firſt births are many times accompanied with hard labours, uſher'd in by ſharp throws and bitter pangs. Our ſecond births are alwayes harder: O the terrors and horrors, the convictions and convulſions, the tremblings of ſoul, and lancings of Conſcience, the thundrings from the Law, the lightnings from hell-fire, with which often this new creature is born! It is hard labour indeed which bringeth this babe of grace into the world.</p>
                  <p>I have read of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that when he was firſt converted, he thought it almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any man to withſtand the evidence and authority of the word of God, whereupon he told one of his friends, that when he came to preach he would make work among ſouls; but after ſome years ſpent in that calling, being demanded what ſucceſſe of his labours; he anſwered that <hi>Old</hi> Adam <hi>was too ſtrong for young</hi> Melancthon. Alas, friend, poſſibly thou mayſt think that thou wilt turn to God hereafter, and thereby prevent thy burning in hell for ever: Believe it, 'tis not ſo eaſie to turn from ſin to God as thou imagineſt: Converſion is another manner of thing, and more hard then moſt men think; thou couldſt ſooner create a world then make thy ſelf a new creature. The reſurrection of thy body if it were dead in the grave, were an eaſier work then the reſurrection of thy ſoul to newneſs of life.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:170410:72"/>
                  <p>As the birth of the natural, ſo the birth of the ſpiritual man requireth infinite ſtrength. It is God, not the midwife, that taketh the child out of the mothers womb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9. The hand of God alone can open that door, and let the lettle infant into the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.31. otherwiſe the womb would be its tomb; So the birth of the new man is wholly from God; and the power wherewith he effects it, is both miraculous and Almighty.</p>
                  <p>Reader, if thou doſt take a brief view what things are wrought when any one is new made, and how little he doth contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to them, nay, how oppoſite he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, thou mayſt perceive that neither Regeneration nor ſalvation are eaſie.</p>
                  <p>Thy mind muſt be enlightened to ſee both ſin and the Saviour; now is it eaſie to open the eye of the blind? who can do it, but he whom <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calleth <hi>totus oculus</hi> all eye? When Jeſus gave ſight to one that was born blind, the Jews themſelves could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him a worker of miracles, <hi>John</hi> 9.6.16. What then will the ſcattering the miſts of ignorance, and diſperſing the clouds of darkneſs which gather and thicken about our underſtandings by nature, ſpeak <hi>the ſun of righteouſneſs</hi> to be! <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. Thy heart alſo muſt be throughly humbled; <hi>ſtone</hi> muſt be turned into <hi>fleſh.</hi> And O 'tis not eaſie to melt ſuch hard mettal, when thy heart natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is like clay hardened both by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170410:73"/>of mercies, and fire of judgement, that no change of weather can make that ſtone to weep. <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.26.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the ſtrong holds of ſin muſt be caſt down, thy old friends muſt be deſerted and proſecuted with implacable hatred, as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable enemies; thoſe beloved luſts, which are at thy <hi>right hand,</hi> and have ſuch a large room in thy heart, muſt be cut off and parted from thee. Thy <hi>dilectum delictum,</hi> the <hi>Iſaac</hi> of thy corruption, which is the child of thy warmeſt affection, in which thou haſt taken ſuch great delight, and from which thou haſt promiſed thy ſelf ſuch large returns of profit, pleaſure, or preferment, muſt be laid on the altar, and have the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing knife of mortification thruſt into the heart of it, and its blood poured out before the Lord. Man, is not <hi>this an hard ſaying!</hi> (as they ſpake in another caſe) <hi>who can hear it?</hi> an hard Leſſon, who can learn it? thy luſt will not like a lamb go ſilently to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but it will roar and rage, fight ſtoutly for its life with many many carnal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and even rend thy heart with its hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous outcryes. Who can tell the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of this beaſt before 'twill be brought to the block? <hi>Dives</hi> and his diſhes, <hi>Balaam</hi> and his wages, <hi>Achan</hi> and his wedges, <hi>Herod</hi> and his <hi>Herodias,</hi> the young man and his great means are not eaſily ſeparated. O how difficult is it to wean the child of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience from thoſe breaſts which he hath
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170410:73"/>ſucked ſo often, and with ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, and to divorce them which like man and wife have been raviſhed with each others love: in works of Art its hard to build, eaſie to deſtroy; in works of nature a tree which hath been many years growing may be cut down in an hour: but in works of ſin its otherwiſe; mans weakneſs can eaſily build them up, but Gods power can onely throw them down. <hi>Pompey,</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaid, That if <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſaw not how they could reſiſt his power, told them, That if he did but ſtamp with his foot on any ground in <hi>Italy</hi> he would bring men enough both footmen and horſemen to do it; but when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was coming with his Army, <hi>Phaonius</hi> bid <hi>Pompey</hi> ſtamp with his feet, and fetch the Souldiers which he had promiſed; but all was in vain; <hi>Pompey</hi> found it more difficult then he thought: for <hi>Caeſar</hi> made him firſt flee, and then in a fight totally routed him. The devil perſwades men that they may defer their regeneration till their diſſolution, and then 'twill be an eaſie matter to foil their ſpiritual foes; but alas, they finde it not ſo eaſie to mortifie earthly members, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the body of death, when their ſouls adverſaries with united ſtrength encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them fiercely, and conquer them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
                  <p>Further, all thy earthly comforts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends, relations, name, eſtate, limbs,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170410:74"/>life, muſt be laid at the feet of Chriſt, hated for his ſake, and parted with at his call and command, and that for the hope of ſuch things as thou never ſaweſt, nor art ever like to ſee while thou liveſt. Is not this, Reader, an hard chapter, to forgo an eſtate in hand for ſomething onely in hope, to throw away preſent poſſeſſions and follow Chriſt thou knoweſt not whither, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an inheritance thou knoweſt not when?</p>
                  <p>And as thy ſins and thy ſoul muſt be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſunder, ſo thy Saviour and thy ſoul muſt be joyned together; faith muſt follow repentance, thy own righteouſneſs muſt be eſteemed as <hi>droſs</hi> and <hi>dung;</hi> the weight of thy ſoul and burthen of thy ſins muſt be laid on the naked croſs of Jeſus Chriſt. Now for thee who art by nature ſo extreamly in love with thy ſelf, to loath thy ſelf; and for thee, notwithſtanding thy diſcouragements from the number and nature of thy ſins, the threatnings and curſes of the Law, the wrath and righteouſneſs of God, to cling about and hang upon the Lord Jeſus, and reſolve, <hi>though he kill thee, yet thou wilt truſt in him;</hi> ſurely this is not eaſie; the work of God in infuſing juſtifying faith, is as great as in faith miraculous; <hi>This is the work of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that ye believe in the name of him whom he hath ſent,</hi> John 6.29. <hi>The work of God,</hi> not onely in regard of its excellency, becauſe no work in man is more
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170410:74"/>pleaſing to God, then believing on his Son, but alſo in regard of its difficulty, becauſe none but a God can enable a man to believe; the bird can as ſoon fly in the egg, as thy ſoul mount up by faith towards heaven, till the Almighty God aſſiſt thee.</p>
                  <p>Further, all the commands of God muſt be heartily embraced, ſome whereof are as contrary to fleſh and blood as fire to water; Self, which is thy great idol, muſt be denied; the world with all its pomp and pride, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Chriſt refuſed; <hi>principalities and powers</hi> rencountred and foiled, thine enemies loved (and if killed, it muſt be with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) godlineſs owned, though much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by others, truth followed cloſe, though it threaten to daſh out thy teeth with its heels, a buffeted Chriſt with his naked Croſs preferred before weighty Crowns; things which reaſon cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, believed; and which none ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, labored for. Friend, are theſe eaſie things? what thinkeſt thou? add to all this the conſideration not onely of thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inability to do theſe things, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thy wickedneſs and contrariety to them; thou art not onely deprived of good, but all over depraved with evil; <hi>The imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoughts of thy heart are evil, onely evil, and that continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. <hi>Thou doſt reſolvedly and obſtinately refuſe good and chooſe evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.11. Jer. 44.16. <hi>The hearts of the ſons of men are fully ſet in them to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170410:75"/>do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.11. obſerve how full that text is, man is reſolved to have his minion, his luſt, though he have wrath and death and hell into the bargain; as the mother of <hi>Nero,</hi> being told that her ſon would be her death if ever he were Emperor, anſwered, <hi>Let him kill me, ſo he may reign;</hi> ſo they ſay, Let ſin reign, though it kill us, though it damn us; <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> If thou wert onely empty of God and grace, the work were more eaſie; but thou art an enemy to grace and godlineſs; <hi>thy carnal minde</hi> (which is Lady Reaſon her ſelf, thy higheſt natural excellency) <hi>is</hi> (not an enemy, for ſuch an one may be reconciled, but in the abſtract) <hi>emnity againſt God.</hi> Thou hateſt God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. His people, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.12. His precepts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.25, 29. His Son, <hi>John</hi> 15.25. and all for his ſake; thou fighteſt againſt him daily, ſinneſt in defiance of him continually, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taileſt thy quarrel upon thy poſterity, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it with thee into the other world (if thou dieſt unregenerate) and there art throwing thine invenom'd darts of blaſphemy, and ſpitting thy poiſon againſt the Moſt High to eternity. Now be thy own judge, is it eaſie to cure that Patient who thus deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hates both Phyſician and Phyſick? <hi>John</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p>Water indeed (ſaith one) may ſomwhat ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be dammed up, but no art nor labour can make it run back in its own channel. It was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170410:75"/>by a miracle, that the river of <hi>Jordan</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back; and it is no leſs then a miracle, that the tide of ſin which ran ſo ſtrong ſhould be turned, that the ſinner who before was ſailing towards Hell, and wanted neither winde nor tide to carry him forward, ſhould now alter his courſe, and tack about for Heaven; This is hard; it is not more ſtrange to ſee the earth flye upward, and fire move downward, then to ſee a ſinner walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his nature, in the wayes of grace and holineſs. Now, Reader, is not that man worſe then mad, that either delayeth or dallieth about his converſion, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that he can do it eaſily enough here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when all this which I have written muſt be wrought in regeneration, and when he is not onely empty of, an enemy to, but even emnity againſt it all!</p>
                  <p>Though the work of converſion (and therefore the way to ſalvation) be thus dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to all, yet to ſome 'tis more difficult then to others. In reſpect of God, indeed, <hi>quoad Deum,</hi> one is as eaſily converted as another; for infinite power and mercy know no difference; but <hi>quoad nos,</hi> in reſpect of us it is more hard to bring ſome towards holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and heaven then others: where the matter is moſt rugged and untoward, its harder to bring it to a good and comely form. Some pieces of timber are more knotty then others, and therefore not ſo eaſily ſquared and fitted for the ſpiritual Temple
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170410:76"/>and heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as others; all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual children are not brought forth with the ſame ſtrength and labour.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall mention three or four ſorts of perſons who are not ſo ſoon as others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to real and unfeigned piety; and truly, my end is, that they may be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rouſed, and effectually renewed before they be eternally ruined.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The meer civil moral man;</hi> This man, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> like, dotes on himſelf, and thereby is hardly brought to deny himſelf; the more the tooth is faſt'ned to the gum, the harder it is to part them; the more the man like a tree is rooted in the earth of ſelf, the more difficult to ſtock him up. The civil man looks on himſelf in the glaſs of ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſinners lives, and finding his face ſo clean and fair in compariſon of theirs, he falls extraordinarily in love with himſelf, which many times proves his deſtruction: He takes his civility for ſanctity, that which is leſs then the ſhadow for the ſubſtance; and without queſtion, 'tis not eaſie to make him eager after godlineſs, when he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he hath it already; a profane perſon is (not ſeldom) ſooner convinced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted then this conceited civilian: for that man will ſooner acknowledge himſelf ſick; but this Patient, though ſick unto death, looks on himſelf as whole, and ſo to have no need of a Phyſician. In this ſenſe, I ſuppoſe, the words of our Lord are ſpoken, <hi>That
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170410:76"/>Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before Scribes and Phariſees, Matth.</hi> 21.31.</p>
                  <p>As a ſhip that is under ſail, though in a contrary courſe, is ſooner brought about, then one that lieth aground in the Harbor can be lanched forth; ſo he that is in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though in a ſinful converſation, is often ſooner reduced, then he that lieth ſtill in the thoughts of his own good condition. As I can ſooner overtake a childe that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from me, then my ſhadow which tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth nigh me, ſo its eaſier to recover a groſs offender, then this ſhadow of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilian; for though he run not ſo far from grace as the other, yet he will be ſure to keep his diſtance. He uſeth his outward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameableneſs as a ſhield to fence off the power of godlineſs; he uſually compareth himſelf with them that are very evil (as a coward chooſing a weak adverſary) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he much excelleth them, therefore concludeth that he is very good. Reader, It is far from my thoughts to diſcourage ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, much leſs to encourage open impiety, (though the whole will of God muſt be taught, what uſe ſoever corrupt hearts will make of it) but to make thee watchfull, that thy outward harmleſneſs prove not a hinderance to inward holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Hypocrite</hi> is one who is with more difficulty then ordinary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Hypocriſie is like a <hi>fiſtula,</hi> which hath
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170410:77"/>a very ſmall orifice, but many turnings and windings in the body (like coney-burrows) ſo that 'tis very hardly diſcerned and cured; this man ſeems to be what a Saint is indeed; and becauſe he is like a godly man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſame duties, and forbearing the ſame iniquities, as to the external part, therefore he gathers, that he is one indeed; but he embraceth a cloud inſtead of <hi>Juno;</hi> he appeareth to be <hi>near the Kingdom of God,</hi> but never careth to come at it; as a parallel line, he keeps a ſcantling with the way of godlineſs, but never meeteth with it: There is ſome particular exception which this man hath taken againſt Chriſt and his ways, that though he may often cheapen, yet he ſeldom buyeth the pearl of price; he eſcapes ſtorms and Pirats at Sea, and makes ſhiprack in the Haven, where deſtruction is no leſs ſure, but much more miſerable; he eſcapes the groſs luſts of <hi>Publicans and Harlots,</hi> and yet is further then both from eternal life.</p>
                  <p>It is harder to convince this man of his ſins then others. If I tell a drunkard, a ſwearer, or an adulterer of his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the neceſſity of converſion, this mans foul converſation is a forcible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to him, yea, and his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will (poſſibly) flye in his face, take part with me, and give evidence againſt him; but if I tell an Hypocrite of the neceſſity of ſanctification, and purſue him with the pieces of the Law, he preſently betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170410:77"/>like the beaſts to his den of duties, and therein ſhelters himſelf; nay his naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being fed and bribed with a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, may plead for him, at leaſt not ſay a word againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, when this man is convinced of his loſt eſtate, its harder to break this mans heart then anothers; for his heart hath not onely a naturall hardneſs, but an extrordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired hardneſs, ſuch an hardneſs as is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by duties and ordinances. Now as where the Sun is moſt powerful, there are the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt mettalls, ſo where the Sun-ſhine of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bleſſings is moſt plentifully enjoyed, and thus wretchedly abuſed, there are the hardeſt hearts. No ſoftning like Goſpel ſoftening, no hardening like Goſpel hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening.</p>
                  <p>Tell a man that never heard of the Goſpel or very ſeldom (when he is convinced of his ſins and miſery) of the love of God in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>his onely Son into the world,</hi> to die, that poor ſinners might not periſh; tell him of the infinite love of Chriſt, in giving himſelf a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for his ſoul; how freely Chriſt invites him, how fully he provides for him, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he is to accept him, how welcome he will make him, O how this man ſometimes falls a weeping, wringing his hands, and renting his heart, that ever he ſhould abuſe ſuch love and mercy, refuſe ſuch incomparable merits, walk in the whole courſe of his heart and life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſuch a bleſſed, glorious, holy, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170410:78"/>gracious God, the word of God doth wound this man to the ſoul; but ſay all this and much more to an Hypocrite, his heart is like the rock not at all moved. The promiſes of God do not cleanſe him from pollutions, but they are as phyſick to which his body hath been much uſed, which ſtirs him not at all, nor purgeth away any ill humours. Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings do not work with him, be they never ſo dreadful and terrible, as a Smiths Dog, being accuſtomed to it, he can ſleep ſecurely, though the ſparkes of the Forge flye about him, nay though the flames of hell flaſh in his face.</p>
                  <p>Reader, if thou ſhouldſt be one of this ſort, for the Lords ſake mind ſoundneſs with ſpeed; for hypocriſy will harden thine heart inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, and every day widen the breach betwixt God and thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The rich man.</hi> The man that is rich in this world is hardly brought to mind the riches of the other world; his heavy load of earth doth much hinder him in his journey to heaven; His riches claſpe about his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Jvy about the Oake, ſucking out the heart of it, for its own leaves and berries. This man taketh up with his preſent poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in compariſon whereof he diſeſteemeth the Saints reverſions. As a Veſſel that is exceedingly laden, when it meets with ſtorms and tempeſts, is with more difficulty kept from ſinking then one which hath but juſt enough to ballaſt it; ſo its more hard to keep
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170410:78"/>him from ſinking into hell, that hath a great eſtate, then him that hath according to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs</hi> wiſh, <hi>neither poverty, nor riches.</hi> And the reaſon is becauſe, <hi>though ſpirituall comforts run low,</hi> this rich man is contented in regard that <hi>his temporal comforts run full-tap.</hi> He makes up the abſence of Chriſt, with the preſence of creatures, when (it may be,) poverty might cauſe him as the prodigal to think of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his fathers houſe, where is ſpiritual plenty.</p>

                     <hi>Quintus Aurelius,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Sylla,</hi> had a fair Grange, which lay convenient for ſome great perſon, which cauſed him to be put in among them that were to be put to death; but as ſoon as he ſaw his name among thoſe that were in the liſt, he cried out <hi>my Land at</hi> Alba <hi>hath kild me.</hi>

                  <p>Some mens Lands have coſt them their lives, and been the knife to cut the throat of their bodies; but many a mans gold hath loſt him his God, and been the knife to cut the throat of his ſoul. Rich men like pamperd horſes are the more unruly, leaping over the hedges of divine precepts, the hardlier kept within their bounds becauſe full fed; the young mans ſilver loſt him his precious ſoul; He went away from Chriſt ſorrowful, <hi>becauſe he had great poſſeſſions;</hi> (Had the man been poor for a few days, he might have been rich for ever; but alas his wealth here through the wickedneſs of his heart cauſed his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting want) whereupon Chriſt tels us; <hi>How
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170410:79"/>hardly ſhall a rich man enter into the Kingdome of Heaven! I ſay unto you that it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of an Needle, then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Mat.</hi> 19.23, 24. Heaven is a ſtately Palace with a narrow portall, through which this Camel with his thick bunch of clay can hardly get. It is obſerved amongſt Anglers, that Pickerils are not eaſily, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten caught. A man may catch an hundred Minums before he take one Pickeril, and the reaſon is, he preyeth at pleaſure on the leſſer fiſh, and therefore ſeldom hath any ſtomack to bite at the bait; ſo it faireth with rich men, their ſtomacks are ſo cloyed with the things of this world, that they have no appetite to the dainties of the word, when <hi>the poor are Goſpellized.</hi> They contentedly take that for their portion, which God intended only for their penſion, and make their wealth their throne to ſit down upon with delight, which God deſigned for their footſtool, and the faithfull laid at the Apoſtles feet.</p>
                  <p>In ſome fenny places in <hi>England</hi> (its ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried) where they are much troubled with gnats, the people hang up dung, to which when they flye they are caught with a net provided there for that purpoſe. The dung of profit is the Devils bait, with which he catcheth many perſons.

                  <p>If Reader, thou art wealthy, be watchfull over thy heart, leſt like Birdlime it hinder the wings of thy ſoul from mounting up to heaven.

Ah 'tis rare indeed to be very rich and truly religious. Such men are often taken out of the world, before the world be taken out of them.</p>
                  <p>Be careful, O Friend, if the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee in earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they prove not heavenly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments; that his mindfulneſs of thy body, do not make thee forgetful of thy ſoul, leſt thy wealth like <hi>Achans</hi> wedge of gold cleave thy ſoul in ſunder.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The old ſinner</hi> is not eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but (like an old maid, when married) hath harder labour then ordinary. The longer the ground of mans heart lieth fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, bringing forth nothing but weeds, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploughed up by repentance, the harder it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170410:80"/>groweth, and with the more difficulty is broken up. 'Twas hard to caſt out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil who had for a long time poſſeſſed the man; the Apoſtles could not do it, and when Chriſt himſelf did it, 'twas not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much <hi>renting and raging, Mark</hi> 9.21, 26.</p>
                  <p>Common experience telleth us, that a ſhip the longer it leaketh, the harder it is to be emptied. An houſe the longer it goeth to ruine, the worſe to repair; a nail the farther it is driven in, the harder to get out; Chriſt raiſed two to life in the Goſpel (beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) one was a maid newly dead, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.54. to whom Chriſt ſpake but little, <hi>Maid, I ſay unto thee ariſe,</hi> and the work was quickly done; the other was one who had been dead ſo long till he ſtunk; now mark what work there was to enliven him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.41. Chriſt weepeth, groaneth in ſpirit, prayeth to his Father, then turneth to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> and cryeth with a loud voyce, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus come forth.</hi> (I only allude to it) When the ſinner hath been but few years dead in ſin, a low voyce of Chriſt can raiſe him up, but when a man hath been not four days, but forty or fifty years rotting in the grave of corruption that he ſtinks in the noſtrils of others, it muſt be a loud voice indeed which muſt quicken him. How hard is it to turn the old ſwine, the old drunkard, to tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and the old goat, the old adulterer to chaſtity! though they be ſo old that their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170410:80"/>bodies cannot act them, yet their helliſh hearts affect them; when they have nothing left but the dog-dayes of their age, <hi>their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies full of ſores, yet their ſouls are fuller of ſins.</hi>

                  <p>The longer the tree ſtandeth in the ground, the more it roots, and the faſter it ſetleth it ſelf; ſo that though a child might ſometime have removed it, yet now all the men in the Pariſh cannot pluck it up. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cuſtom in ſin takes away all conſcience of ſin,</hi> and hardeneth the heart more againſt God and godlineſs: As a youth when he firſt cometh to be Apprentice to ſome handicraft trade, his hand is very tender, and no ſooner is it ſet to work, but it bliſters, and puts him to pain; but he continuing long at the trade, his hand hardens, and he can follow his work, not onely without pain, but with much pleaſure: ſo when a man is a young ſinner, conſcience is tender, like a a queaſie ſtomach, troubled much with the leaſt thing that offends it; but continuance in ſin makes conſcience ſeared and brawny, that afterwards the ſinner like the Oſtrich, can digeſt iron, and like the Turkiſh ſlaves feed on Opium, and his ſtomach not at all recoil or complain.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of the Cretians, that when they curſed their enemies, they did not wiſh fire in their houſes, nor a dagger
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170410:81"/>at their hearts, but that which would bring greater wo, <hi>ut mala conſuetudine delectentur,</hi> that they might delight in an evil cuſtom; for cuſtom is not another nurture, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature and that which is natural is not eaſily reduced.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay there is no tranſplanting trees after ſeven years rooting. I am ſure it is hard to tranſplant them out of a ſtate of nature into a ſtate of grace, who have been ſeventy years rooting in the earth; old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants will not eaſily leave their maſters, they will many times have their ears boared, and be everlaſting ſlaves rather then be made free.</p>

Reader, though the <hi>Book of life</hi> (which includeth the names of thoſe whoſe heads are deſtined to glorious Diadems) be ſecret, yet the deſerts of thoſe inſcribed there are open; they are <hi>as a choſen generation, a peculiar people,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>an holy nation, a royal Prieſthood,</hi> a called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, a ſanctified ſociety, a regenerated remnant; they are culled out of the world, called by the word, ſeparated for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Lord; <hi>they are born of the Spirit,</hi> brought up in the Spirit, and they walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit.

                  <p> Firſt, Conſider that thy <hi>All</hi> hangs on this hinge of regeneration. All that thou art worth for thine unchangeable eſtate in the other world dependeth on this. This is the foundation of that hope, that building which reacheth to heaven; now tis dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to err in fundamentals; the ſtability of the building depends on the ſtrength of the foundation. For a man to go out of his way at the firſt ſetting out, is ſaddeſt of all. Regeneration is the beginning of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in thee; nay thy intereſt in all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches in Chriſt, ſtandeth on this; if regenerated, then thy ſins are pardoned, thy perſon accepted, God is thy Father, Jeſus Chriſt thy Husband and Saviour, the Spirit thy Comforter, the Promiſes are thy portion, Heaven thy home; but if thou art not adorned with the pious fruits of Chriſts Spirit, thou art not intereſted in the precious fruits of his merits; therefore make ſure here. God will deal with thee to eternity according to thy having or wanting this. Now doth it not concern thee to beware of cozening thy ſelf here, when a miſtake in this will make thee miſerable for ever? if ever any treſſes had need be ſtrong, then ſurely they which draw ſuch a weight as thine endleſs wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. <hi>Where men intend to dwell long, thy build ſtrong.</hi> Soldiers uſe tents which have no foundation, becauſe they intend but a ſhort ſtay in them; <hi>thou lookeſt for a City which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170410:84"/>hath a foundation.</hi> Friend, hath thy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it any foundation! wouldſt thou build ſleightly for a dwelling of eternity! <hi>Zeuxes</hi> being asked why he was ſo exact in painting, anſwered, Becauſe he painted for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Lines w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> concern eternity had need be exactly drawn; and deeds, and marks, and all things indeed which concern eternity, had need to be exquiſitely done. If a Merchant venture all his eſtate in one veſſel, and where there is much hazard in the voyage, how full of fear and care will he be, leſt the ſhip ſhould miſcarry, himſelf and his family be ruined! many a ſad thought will he have in the day as ſowr ſawce to his food, and poſſibly many an aking heart in the night to keep him waking. He is even like to be beſide himſelf, ſo much is he perplexed; and ask him the reaſon, he will tell you, I think I have cauſe, All that I am worth is ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that bottom; ſhould it be loſt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, we are all loſt, my wife, ſelf, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt all periſh: Thus the man lives in little eaſe both day and night, till at laſt he conſidereth with himſelf of what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſafety of that veſſel is to him; he reſolveth, and accordingly goeth to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers Office, and enſureth his whole eſtate, and then he is ſatisfied; thoſe fears which like weights hung on the clock of his heart, and would not ſuffer it to reſt, are now taken off, and he eats his bread with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and drinks his wine with a merry
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170410:84"/>heart: he can in all conditions be contented, becauſe <hi>his All is enſured.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Reader, Regeneration is the veſſell, in which all that thou art worth, not for this preſent periſhing, but for the other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting world is ventured; if that be ſound, thine endleſs welfare is ſafe; if that be feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and lame, thou art loſt for ever. How cauſt thou take any comfort in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of fading creatures, whilſt thy <hi>All,</hi> thine Eternity is in danger! O go to the Enſuring Office, bring thy riches, thy ſilver to the ballance of the Sanctuary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by try whether it hath its full weight.</p>
                  <p>Man, what ſayſt thou to this reaſon for ſelf examination? is it not of unſpeakable weight? and I ſhall ſhew thee that tis of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable truth. Doth not the living God tell thee <hi>that except thou art born again, thou ſhall not ſee his Kingdom?</hi> Doth he not ſay expreſly that <hi>without are dogs? Rev.</hi> 22.15. The fathers houſe is onely for children; <hi>Dogs muſt be without doors.</hi> Pharaohs court admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of vermine; but I can aſſure that Gods will not; <hi>Into it can in no wiſe enter any thing that is defiled or unclean, Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>ult.</hi> Impure perſons can never get into the moſt holy place. <hi>Heaven muſt be in thee, before thou canſt be in heaven.</hi> It was a good inſcription, which a bad man wrot on the door of his houſe, <hi>Per me nihil intret mali.</hi> Let no evil paſſe through me: whereupon ſaid <hi>Diogenes, Quomodo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredietur dominus.</hi> How then ſhall the Maſter
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170410:85"/>get into his own houſe? That inſcription with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion agreeth with the celeſtiall habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; There is nothing there but what is holy. The Creatour is eſſentially, infinitely and eternally holy; the <hi>father</hi> is <hi>holy, John</hi> 17.11. <hi>the holy child Jeſus, Acts,</hi> 14.27. <hi>the holy Ghoſt, Acts,</hi> 21.11. the creatures there are holy, <hi>the holy angels, Mark</hi> 8.38. the <hi>ſaints</hi> or <hi>holy men and women, Heb.</hi> 12.23. The work and eternall imployment there is holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the ſervants wait on their Maſter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinning, as well as without ceaſing; the ſong there is <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, Rev.</hi> 4.8. canſt thou therefore think without holineſs to get thither?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider <hi>that God will try thee.</hi> He knoweth now what thou art, whether droſs or gold, and he will ſhortly bring thee to the fire and make thee known, both to thy ſelf and others. Though the waters of thy corruptions may run for a time under ground, and be hidden from the eyes of men, yet they will at length appear; Thou art at preſent all Chryſtal to God (he needeth not, as <hi>Momus</hi> would have, a window into thy breaſt) for he ſeeth thee throughly; he ſeeth thy inwards more perfectly then thou and others can ſee thy outward parts. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pot is for ſilver, &amp; the furnance for <hi>gold, but the Lord tryeth the heart, Prov.</hi> 17.3. He hath a thread, which leadeth him uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly through the labyrinth of thy heart.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170410:85"/>He needeth no ſerious inquiſition about thee; for he knoweth thee by immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition. He walks through the road of thy heart every hour; therefore it concerneth thee not to balke it.</p>
                  <p>He will try thee probably, in life; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly at death and judgment; and ſhouldeſt not thou then try thy ſelf? God may trie thee in life by proſperity, he may give thee ſtrong meat, and thereby examine thy ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach whether it be good or bad; he may let the world flow in upon thee, to trye how thy affections will flow out upon it; Believe it, rich wines will try thy brains. It is ſad of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> (ſo called becauſe) that when he was a mean man he was looked upon as a good man,
<note place="margin">Magiſtratus indicat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> and had great hopes of his own ſalvation; but when he came to be a Cardinal he doubted much about it, and when he was a Pope he altogether deſpaired of it; thus the place doth often diſcover the perſon. Hot waters will manifeſt whether there be life in a man or no; and a full great wind will try whether the veſſell of thy ſoul be ballaſted with grace or no. Its ſaid of <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> there was never better ſervant, nor worſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Poiſonous and profitable roots are both diſcovered in ſummer, though they were hid all the winter. That corruption which lay in the body undiſcerned when the ſeaſon was cold, breaks out either in the face by pimples, or in the other parts, by ſome diſeaſe when the weather is warm. But tis more likely that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170410:86"/>God will try thee by adverſity, God telleth <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that he <hi>would ſearch her with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. Zeph.</hi> 1.12. That is, as exactly as men ſearch with candles, prying into every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the houſe (ſo God of the heart) bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth their ſecret ways, revealing their hidden wickedneſs, the words imply both the manner how exactly God would do it, and the means how terribly he would do it, by ſome dreadfull judgment; he would kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fire and ſearch them by the light of that fire. Reader, if thou wilt not ſearch thy ſoul by the Sun-light of his word, expect that he ſhould ſearch thee by the candle light, the fire light of his dreadful works. The flail of tribulation will diſcover the chaffe from the wheat; and the fire of affliction, the droſs from the gold. Sharp weather will try whether thy body be ſound or ſickly. A ſtorm will diſcover the Mariner, and a battel the Soldier. God led <hi>Iſrael</hi> about in the wilderneſs to try and to prove them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. Affliction is like <hi>Solomons</hi> ſword, that diſcovereth which is the true, which the falſe mother; or like <hi>Simeons</hi> ſword which pierceth through mens ſouls, <hi>that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now friend, if God will try thee by ſome ſharp affliction, is it not better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this by ſelf-examination? It may be God may try thee by diſgrace, or loſs of thy whole eſtate, or by loſs of liberty, limbs, or life; now how wilt thou do to bid adieu to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170410:86"/>all earthly comforts for Jeſus Chriſt; to welcom a priſon, kiſs a ſtake, ſmile at tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, look a violent death in the face with colour in thy cheeks, and courage in thy heart, to endure this fiery trial by God, that didſt never try thy ſelf before hand! <hi>If thou haſt run with footmen, and they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thee, how will thou do to run with horſemen? Jer.</hi> 14.5. If ſelf-trial in thy chamber or cloſet (where are none but God and thy conſcience to be witneſſes, and Scripture to be judge of the controverſie) be ſo irkſom and grievous to thee, how tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will thy trial be by flames and torments? Believe it, when thou comeſt to the fire, 'twill be known whether thou art a full or an empty pitcher. Bleſſed <hi>Bilny,</hi> tried his finger by himſelf in the candle, before his whole bodie in the flames at the ſtake. <hi>O gather your ſelves together,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Gather your ſelves together, before the decree bring forth, before the day paſs, as the chaff before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you. Tremelius</hi> reads it, <hi>Excutite vos, verumque Excutite.</hi> Examine, unskin your ſelves, rip your ſelves up, diſſect, ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize your intrails; its doubled, to ſhew the fervency and earneſtneſs of God for it, the neceſſity and weight of it, and mans anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and averſeneſs to it, <hi>before the decree bring forth,</hi> &amp;c. before the judgement which is now in the womb of the threatning come to the birth of execution. O, Friend, ſearch
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170410:87"/>thy ſelf faithfully, or be confident that God will ſearch thee dreadfully. Now, as <hi>Job</hi> told his friends, <hi>Is it good that God ſhould ſearch thee out?</hi> Job 13.9. Is it good that he ſhould as a Surgeon, eat out thy dead ſenſeleſs fleſh by ſome ſtinging corroſive, and cure thee of thy lethargy by putting thee into a violent feavor? The Schollar that will not ſcan his own verſes, and try them by the rule, findes that his maſter can make him do it under the rod. If God have thoughts of everlaſting favor towards thee, he will force thee to know and try thy ſelf by ſome ſeaſonable fire; he will ſo ſhake the tree, that it ſhall be known whether the fruit be rotten or found.</p>
                  <p>If God ſhould not try and diſcover thee to thy ſelf in this world, yet he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the other world, at the night of death, and in the day of judgment: Death will try thee, that will be ſtrong phyſick which will fully diſcover thy conſtitution. Two or more children play together all day; but when night comes, one childe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his father, the other to his father, every one to his own father; it may be they were very like one another, that ſtrangers knew not, yea, nor neighbours to whom they belonged, whoſe child was this, or whoſe child is that; but when night comes, one father owns his childe, takes him home; the other father calls his childe to him, takes him into his houſe: Thus, while men live they are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170410:87"/>not ſo well diſcovered, whether they are <hi>of God, or of their father the Devil;</hi> but when the night of death comes, they are tried to whom they belong: <hi>He that is born of God goeth to his Fathers houſe;</hi> He that is <hi>of his father the Devil,</hi> goeth with <hi>Judas to his own place.</hi> Rotteneſt ſtuffs are ofteneſt watered, the deformedſt faces are uſually painted, but the ſhowre of death will wipe and waſh all off.</p>
                  <p>Now if thou wouldſt be gathered to thy father in peace, examine and prove thy ſelf; make ſure <hi>that there be ſome good thing in thee towards the Lord thy God:</hi> O how ſad will it be for thee, who art now aſleep, to awake (like the Jaylor) at the midnight of death, and to finde thy evidences for the new birth (as he his priſoners in his own apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) miſſing! what an earthquake and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake will then poſſeſs thee! how pale and trembling wilt thou ſpring into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, in the other world for thy particular judgement! Ah, how ſad will it be to err to miſtake then, when an error can never, never be mended, when a miſtake will prove ſoul murther, an everlaſting miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage! O, 'tis bad for the veſſel of thy ſoul to leak, to miſtake in the ſhallow wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life and time; but, O how ſad will it be to be miſtaken at an hour of death, and thereby to leak in the Ocean of Eternity! <hi>Speed</hi> in his Chronicles obſerveth, that in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Campius,</hi> the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170410:88"/>Popes Legate came through the ſtreets of <hi>London</hi> with twenty mules laden, to ſhow his pomp; but as the triumph paſſed through <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> the beaſts ſtumbled, brake their collars, caſt their coffers, and then the lids flying open, diſcovered his riches to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>old ſhooes</hi> and <hi>boots, torn ſtockings, old iron,</hi> and <hi>totter'd rags.</hi> I tell thee, Reader, though now thou mayſt be wonder'd at for thy ſpiritual wealth; yet as ſoon as thou ſtumbleſt into the other world, 'twill be tried, 'twill be known whether they be real or imaginary riches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> told his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.19. <hi>I will come to you ſhortly, and will know, not the ſpeech of them that are puffed up, but the power: for the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power: What will ye? ſhall I come to you with a rod, or in love?</hi> O Friend, not <hi>Paul,</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf will come to thee by death ſhortly, and will know, not thy <hi>ſpeech,</hi> in being puffed up with a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of profeſſion, but <hi>the power,</hi> and try whether thou haſt the ſubſtance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now, man, what wilt thou? ſhall he come to thee <hi>with a rod, or in love?</hi> ſhall he ſend good Angels to guard thee to Heaven, or evil Angels to drag thee to Hell?</p>
                  <p>When <hi>David</hi> was going to encounter with <hi>Goliah,</hi> he told <hi>Saul,</hi> that he could not go with the armor which <hi>Saul</hi> had put on him, becauſe <hi>he had not proved it,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.39. And dareſt thou enter the liſt againſt a far
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170410:88"/>greater enemy, even <hi>death,</hi> with that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor which was never proved? be confident, if thou fighteſt without armor of proof, death will foil thee.</p>
                  <p>The day of Judgement will try thee; then naked breaſts will be in faſhion, and God will rip thee open before the world; nay, if thou wilt not now examine thy ſelf to thy converſion, he will examine thee then to thy confuſion. When the Judge ſhall be a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> and the whole world be in a flame, and thou be tried by <hi>a fiery Law, Hebr.</hi> 12.28. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.2. 'Twas a ſharp kind of examination by which <hi>Paul</hi> was examined, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.14. <hi>The chief Captain commanded that he ſhould be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſcourging.</hi> 'Tis a ſad kinde of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by which many Countreys examine Malefactors, upon the wrack, putting them to exquiſite pains.</p>
                  <p>Reader, Remember that if thou doſt not examine thy ſelf at this day, God will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thee at the laſt day, and 'twill be <hi>an examination upon the wrack,</hi> an <hi>examination with ſcourging;</hi> it will be a word and a wound, every blow will fetch blood; every interrogation will be a ſtabbing, ſtinging, killing queſtion: When Chriſt ſhall ſay to thee, <hi>Sinner, how didſt thou dare thus to cozen and undo thy ſoul! what madneſs poſſeſſed thee thus to dally about matters of infinite and endleſs moment! Hadſt thou examined thy ſelf according to my word, and found thy ſelf loſt,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170410:89"/>there had then been ſome hopes of life; but I tell thee now 'tis too late: Well, Ile rip thee open before Angels and men, and cauſe thy conſcience with its gnawing worm and ſtinging gripes to examine thee eternally. The fire of hell ſhall try what mettal thou art, that will prove thee to purpoſe.</hi> O friend, think of this ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpeedily, for that day of Chriſt will declare thee; and Alas, alas, <hi>who ſhall abide the day of his trial, or who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth? for he is like refiners fire, and as fullers ſope. All things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom thou ſhalt then have to do.</hi> If thou art afraid to venture a trial in the low Court of Conſcience, where his Word ſhall be thy Judge, with what fear and trembling wilt thou appear at his bar, when he that ſearcheth thine heart, trieth thy reins, and will reward thee according to thy works, ſhall ſit upon the Bench: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt up thy accounts before God and thy ſoul, whilſt there is hope of making all even; leſt thou do as ſome Tradeſmen, who neglect ſo long to caſt up their books, till at laſt their books caſt them up.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider it is poſſible to know whether thou art new born, or no. I do not ſet thee to beat the air, or to work at the labour in vain. A Chriſtian may be aſſured of his regeneration and thereby of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They which have the law of God written in their hearts, may be able to read it. <hi>David,</hi> when his deeds and evidences were not blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170410:89"/>with his foul offences, could diſcern them clearly, <hi>Thy law is within my heart, Pſalm,</hi> 40.8. When the Sun ariſeth he bringeth his naturall light with him, whereby he is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the world. A diamond ſet in a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring bringeth ſuch an orient ſparkling with it, that it cauſeth men to diſcern it; truly ſo the Sun of righteouſneſs when he ariſeth in the ſoul, bringeth a ſpiritual light along with him, which helpeth the new creature to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, and the Diamond of Grace caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch a ſparkling luſtre in the heart of a Chriſtian, that it thereby becomes viſible.</p>
                  <p>Regeneration makes a wonderful change and alteration; now great alterations of State are not without obſervation. Doth a Kingdom change its Governor, a cruel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Tyrant, that fleeced them, and ſlew them at pleaſure, for a mild merciful peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prince, that ruleth them with a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcepter, and not take notice of it? Can a creature change his maſter, ſin and fleſh, for Chriſt and his Spirit; his work of <hi>ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3.3. for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord with ſingleneſs of heart, and not obſerve it? When the man is new made, Chriſt cometh into his heart with his Spirit, Graces, Goſpel: great Gueſts when they come into an houſe, have many eyes upon them; the King of Glory doth not come with ſuch a train and retinue in ſecret; the gradual change from grace to grace is not ſo viſible; but a ſpecifical change from nature
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170410:90"/>to grace is undoubtedly ſenſible: when the ground that before brought forth nothing but weeds and thiſtles, comes to bring forth wheat; an ordinary perſon may perceive the difference, though how this wheat groweth is not ſo perceptible. Every new creature doth not know the time, nor man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor means of his converſion, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may know that he is converted: The mother doth not know how ſhe comes to be quick, but ſhe knoweth that ſhe is quick, for the feeleth the childe to ſtir in her womb: how the ſhadow moveth on the dial we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, but that it moveth we ſee plainly, in that its oppoſite at night to the place where it was at noon. Though converſion be not ever ſenſible in the act, yet it is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enough by its effects; and the reaſon why it is not in all alike viſible, is becauſe it is not in all alike violent. God convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome by <hi>Boanerges, ſons of thunder;</hi> others by a <hi>Barnabas, a ſon of conſolation;</hi> to ſome he comes, as on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> Exod. 19. <hi>with thundrings, lightnings, and a great noiſe;</hi> to others, as to <hi>Elijah, with a ſtill ſmall voice,</hi> 2 Kings 19.12. The Spirit falls down on ſome, as on the Apoſtles, like a mighty ruſhing winde, or like fire ſhaking and ſcorching them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2, 3. on others, as on Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſhape of a Dove, dealing mildly and meekly with them: The Jaylor is brought home by an earthquake, and an heartquake, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.29. when the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170410:90"/>door of <hi>Lydia</hi>'s heart is opened ſoftly, and Jeſus Chriſt entereth in without any noiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. Some in a ſown are revived onely by pouring a little hot water down their throats, whereas others muſt be rub'd hard and beaten ſore before they will come to themſelves again, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Ere I was aware, my ſoul made me like the charints of Aminadab.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some have been infamous for pleaſure in ſin, and ſuch are uſually made more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of the pain due to ſinners; God bringeth all home by weeping croſs, but them eſpecially that have been moſt wicked: The Phyſician is forced to give ſtrong phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to ſuch ſturdy ſtrong patients, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will not work: A man that is an old finner, is like one that hath had a bone long out of joynt, and its feſtered, this man muſt feel much pain before it be brought into its right place.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God intendeth to liſt a ſoul high with ſpiritual conſolations, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it for them, he layeth it low with legal humiliation: We throw the ball hard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ground, when we intend that it ſhall bound high; <hi>Paul</hi> was forcibly caſt to the earth, before he was favorably caught up to the third heaven.</p>
                  <p>Some are deſigned to be high in holineſs, eminent patterns of piety to others, and ſuch are often filled with ſorrow, and do more then others feel the ſmart of ſin:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170410:91"/>When the workman will make his building high and exact, he layeth the foundation deep and low.</p>
                  <p>God is not limited, he dealeth with men as he ſeeth good; it is his will (and that is reaſon enough) that all his children ſhould not be brought forth with the ſame pain: He hath ſeveral medicines (whereof ſome are more ſweet, others more ſowre) for the cure of their ſpiritual maladies, and he applieth them as it pleaſeth him.</p>
                  <p>Now when the Spirit of God worketh moſt forcibly, then the man perceiveth it moſt ſenſibly: Beſides, ſome men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have had inclinations towards God and godlineſs ever ſince they came to any knowledge; they ſuckt the milk of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the breaſts of their parents, I mean their religious education: <hi>Obadiah feared the Lord from his youth,</hi> 1 Kings 18.12. <hi>Timothy from a childe knew the holy Scriptures;</hi> The dews of grace were dropt from Heaven upon their ſouls early, in the morning of their age; and in ſuch caſes converſion, as to the time and manner of it, is under a cloud: For as he that is lock'd up in ſome dark dungeon, may eaſily diſcover the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, when either the leaſt beam of the Sun, or glimmering of day-light did break in upon him; whereas he that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the open air, is ſenſible that the day is broke, that the Sun is riſen, but cannot tell you preciſely when the day ſprang, or the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170410:91"/>Sun roſe; ſo ſome that have been betimes put out apprentices to the devil by their parents, been taught that helliſh trade of ſin, and nurtured in obſtinacy and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, being lock'd up and fettered in the Dungeon of darkneſs, as <hi>Peter</hi> in priſon; theſe men may eaſily remember the time, when <hi>the day-ſtar from on high did viſit them;</hi> when the Angel of the Covenant came upon them, and cauſed a light to ſhine about them, and raiſed them up, and cauſed their fetters to fall off, the priſon door to flye open, and commanded them to ariſe and follow him; but thoſe that were ever in the open air, <hi>brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord:</hi> (like veſſels, when new ſeaſoned with holineſs) thoſe cannot tell you the day when ſalvation came to their ſouls; they can tell you that day is broke, but when they know not; one thing <hi>they know, that where as they were blind, now they ſee,</hi> but how they came by their ſight they cannot certifie you; they can tell you, that they are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the ſeaſon of it they cannot tell. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, though the time and manner of this work makes the knowledge of it more eaſie and ſenſible to ſome then to others, yet to all 'tis poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Gods precepts ſpeak it poſſible; God requireth of his people ſuch things as would be to no purpoſe, if they could not be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of their grace and purity: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth <hi>to examine themſelves, whether they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170410:92"/>are in the faith or no,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. Now to what purpoſe or end ſhould the Law of God be produced, the perſons heart and life compared with it, witneſſes be examined, the man thus arreigned in the Court of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if the matter in debate could not be brought to an iſſue, if it could not be known whether he be ſanctified or not? God bids us <hi>make our callings and elections ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. therefore they may be enſured: We are enjoyned to pray with confidence, and to call God Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. which certainly none can do, if none can know that they are his children.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle tells us, that we muſt rejoyce in the Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1. and that alwayes, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16. even in tribulation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.10. which who can do, if he know not whether God be his friend or enemy?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the promiſes of God ſhew it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>I will love him</hi> (that keepeth my commandments) <hi>and manifeſt my ſelf unto him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>ult.</hi> and 85.8, 9. now what Gods mercy promiſeth, his truth performeth.</p>
                  <p>The helps likewiſe which God affords us, ſpeak this feaſible. The ſcripture ſetteth down the ſigns of the men and women which are ſanctified, and which ſhall be ſaved. <hi>And hereby we know that we know him if we keep his commandments.</hi> To know that we know him, is to be aſſured that we know him, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170410:92"/>that believe on the name of the ſon of God, that ye may know that ye have eternall life,</hi> Mark, they did believe before, yet St. <hi>John</hi> writes that they might believe; they had before the faith of adherence, <hi>John</hi> writes to them that they might have the faith of aſſurance. The Sacraments are alſo given as broad ſeals, and the Spirit as the privy ſeal of heaven, to enſure ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.30.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the patterns and experiences of the Saints ſpeak this poſſible; that which others have acquired, is not impoſſible to us. The children of God, have been aſſured of their adoption, that God was their father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>Though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknowledge us not, doubtleſs thou art our father, thou O Lord art our father, and our redeemer.</hi> They have been aſſured of their juſtification, <hi>Job</hi> 13.18. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 45.24. perſeverance in grace, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, to the end. Of their right to glory and ſalvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know that when the houſes of our earthly tabernacles ſhall be diſſolved, we ſhall enjoy a building of God an houſe not made with hands, but eternall in the heavens.</hi> So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Job.</hi> 19.25. 2 Tim. 1.12. And all this aſſurance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, juſtification, perſeverance in grace, fruition of glory, which Saints have, doth proceed from their aſſurance of their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170410:93"/>brethren.</hi> Regeneration or holineſs is the firſt fruits which do enſure the harveſt, and the earneſt which doth confirme the bargain and enſure the full ſum.</p>
                  <p>Now Reader having given thee ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to quicken thee to try thy ſoul, I ſhall lay down the markes, and bring thee to the teſt. And they ſhall be taken from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and effects of regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, examine thine heart by the nature of this true holineſs. Now there are two things in the nature of this new creature. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry birth there is <hi>Generatio unius &amp; corruptio alterius,</hi> ſaith the Philoſopher, ſomething ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and ſomething deſtroyed; ſo in this new birth there is the production of grace, and the deſtruction of vice; <hi>the life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the death of ſin;</hi> the ſetting up of the Arke, and the throwing down of <hi>Dagon.</hi> The ſinfullneſs of our ſouls by our firſt births, conſiſteth in their averſion from God and good, and in their converſion <hi>to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil one,</hi> and evil; in having the image of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan imprinted on them, and the image of God blotted out of them. The ſanctity of our ſouls by their ſecond births, conſiſteth in their converſion to God, and their averſion from ſin, in having the image of the Devil razed out of them, and the image of the Saviour ſtamped on them. <hi>As we have born the image of the earthly, ſo we muſt bear the image of the heavenly.</hi> And theſe two parts <hi>of the good part,</hi> are like two Buckets in a Well,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170410:93"/>as the one (namely the intereſt of God) cometh up, the other (namely the intereſt of ſin and Satan) goeth down; the higher the Sun getteth, the more ſtill it ſcattereth the darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is in this new nature a dying to ſin. The Apoſtle calleth it <hi>a putting off the old man, Eph.</hi> 4.22. and a dying to ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. Converſion like the ſhip-mans fatal ſtar, is never ſeen but before the wrack and death of ſin. The ſpring of grace is a living fountain and cleanſeth it ſelf of mire and dirt. Grace like Chriſt increaſeth, and ſin like the Baptiſt decreaſeth. The expreſſion of the holy Ghoſt about this is worthy our ſerious conſideration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we ſhould not ſerve ſin; for he that is dead is freed from ſin.</hi> Lo, here, ſin is ſerved by Chriſt the ſame ſauce, which it formerly ſerved Chriſt, Sin crucified him, when he came <hi>in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> and he ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it when he cometh into the ſoul by his Spirit; but in the words of the Apoſtle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Sins appellation, and its execution. For its appellation, it is called, firſt <hi>the Old man;</hi> partly becauſe it is derived and propagated from <hi>Adam,</hi> the eldeſt of men; partly in compariſon of renovation, and renewing the whole man. It is called ſecondly, the <hi>body of ſin,</hi> partly becauſe mans corrupt nature, like a body or ſtock, brancheth forth into
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170410:94"/>divers actual ſins as members, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. partly becauſe of the ſtrength of it, as alſo becauſe men are as much naturally in love with their ſins as with themſelves. But take notice of the execution of this <hi>old man of this body of ſin in the regenerate. The old man is crucified:</hi> Sin like an old man in them which are new made, doth decay and decline every day; it is every hour growing weaker and weaker, and nearer to its grave and utter abolition. Regeneration giveth ſin its deaths wound, though as thoſe that are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, it dyeth lingringly, yet it dieth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. Sin (like a man in a conſumption) in a converted perſon is always waſting and dying till at laſt it's quite dead. One that is mortally wounded ſprawleth and moveth for a time, but afterwards giveth up the Ghoſt; ſo ſin, while Saints live, though it be mortally wounded doth rage and ſtir, but it abateth in ſtrength and dyeth with them.</p>

                  <p>The Scripture ſpeaketh expreſly, <hi>He that is born of God, ſinneth not,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. that is conſtantly; ſin is not his deſign or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and chearfully, ſin is not his delight
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170410:94"/>or element; for ſin is againſt his new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; now a man can do nothing againſt his nature cordially or conſtantly; Sin may rebel within him, but it cannot reign over him; he looks on ſin as his greateſt enemy, and therefore 'tis impoſſible that he ſhould converſe with it in a way of amity. Nay, as fire and water, heat and cold never meet but they fight; ſo this new life is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual war with every luſt; the new creature is like unto God, <hi>Of purer eyes then to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.13. the evil of ſin cannot ordinarily get a good look from him; he cannot meet this ugly gueſt in any corner of his houſe, but his heart riſeth againſt him; he conſidereth what a Lord ſin diſpleaſeth, what a Law ſin tranſgreſſeth, what a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful image ſin defaceth, what a glorious name fin diſhonoreth, what a lovely loving Savior ſin buffetted ſhamefully, and tortured cruelly, what a precious ſoul, and peerleſs ſalvation ſin was like to have loſt him eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. And Oh 'tis a killing look which this ſoul giveth his deareſt luſt: Ah thinks he, that ever my nature ſhould hatch and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſuch hideous monſters, that ever my heart ſhould be a polluted bed to breed and bring forth ſuch a poiſonous brood: 'Twas my iniquity that bid defiance to the higheſt Majeſty; 'twas my corruption which ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the back, wounded the head, nailed the feet and hands, yea pierced the very heart of Jeſus Chriſt; my wickedneſs was the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170410:95"/>weight which cauſed his bloody ſweat; my luſt was the murderer, which put to death that Lord of life; 'twas my covetouſneſs which betrayed him, my cowardlineſs which condemned him, and my cruelty which execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; and ſhal I be a friend to that Traytor, which was ſuch a foe to my Redeemer! Well, whatever it coſt me, through the ſtrength of Chriſt Ile have juſtice upon theſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers; through the help of heaven theſe brats of hell ſhall have their brains daſht out: his great care is every day to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his corruptions. The body of ſin and death to which he is tied, is as noiſom to his ſoul, as a dead body to his ſenſes. Luſt is as burthenſom to him as a withered arm, which hangs on a man like a lump of lead. Never did priſoner more ardently deſire to be rid of his fetters, then this Saint to be freed from ſubjection to his ſins: The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Jews did not groan ſo much under their Egyptian ſlavery, as this true Iſraelite for ſpiritual liberty; <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin and death?</hi> Rom. 7.29. His great end, and endeavor in every providence and every Ordinance, is, not the repreſſion but the ruine of this evil of ſin. If the Sun of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhine warm upon him, he makes uſe of it to put out the kitchin fire of wickedneſs: When God folaceth his ſpirit with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary kindneſs, the ſacrifice of thankſgiving that he offereth up is the beaſt of ſome ſin,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170410:95"/>which he layeth on the Altar, and poureth forth its blood before the Lord: When the ſtorm of affliction ariſeth, he enquireth for the <hi>Jonah</hi> which raiſed the tempeſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth that he may be caſt over-board, and drowned.</p>
                  <p>And as he makes uſe of divine Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo likewiſe of divine Ordinances, for the weakening his corruptions.</p>
                  <p>In prayer, like the ſick childe, he point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the place of his pain; he indicteth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth and condemneth ſin, and intreateth that it may be executed; his prayers and tears are his daily weapons, wherewith he fighteth againſt his moſt inward and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wickedneſs. When he perceiveth luſt like <hi>Adonijah,</hi> uſurping the throne of his heart, he goeth in to God, as <hi>Bathſheba</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> ſighing, and ſaying, <hi>Did not my Lord promiſe his ſervant, that the true</hi> Solomon <hi>ſhould reign in my ſoul? that Jeſus Chriſt the Prince of Peace ſhould ſway the ſcepter in my ſpirit? And now behold his foes, which thou haſt ſworn to make his footſtool, have trayterouſly aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Crown, and forcibly made me ſubject to their commands.</hi> As <hi>Eſther,</hi> he is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of theſe <hi>Hamans</hi> deſtruction, and watcheth continually for a fit opportunity to preſent his Petition to the King of Kings for that end; and when in any duty he ſeeth the God of glory to hold out the golden Scepter of mercy towards him; O, then he beggeth for juſtice: <hi>If I have found favour in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170410:96"/>thy ſight, O King, and if it pleaſe the King; let the life of my ſoul be given me at my Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the death of my ſins at my requeſt: Did thy dear Son die for ſin, and ſhall thy poor ſervant live in ſin? ſhall not theſe thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which would not have thee to reign over me, be ſlain before thy face? Order my ſteps by thy word, and let not any iniquity have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over me,</hi> Pſal. 119.133. Thus by prayer, as by one main piece of his ſpiritual armour, he becomes prevalent. The Romans over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their enemies ſitting, (that is, the Senate by their prudent counſels) but the Chriſtian kneeling, by his holy valour he wreſtleth with God, and through the power of Chriſt gets the victory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.6.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the devil of ſome luſts will not be caſt out without faſting and prayer, therefore he joyneth faſting to ſupplication, and trieth to ſtarve his corruptions: Before-hand he fitteth himſelf for that day of purging out his ill humors, by the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory potion of meditation. The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſins, how bloody and hainous in their nature, how crying and crimſon in their circumſtances, makes his phyſick work the better. He thinketh before, <hi>The day of mourning for (offending) my father is coming, and then I will ſlay my brother</hi> Jacob, <hi>my deareſt and neareſt ſin.</hi> This man bringeth under his natural body (which he may lawfully cheriſh) that he may abate the ſtrength of the body of death; as men ſometimes in a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170410:96"/>feaver open a vain, and let out their blood, (though it be not bad) that they may wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their enemy.</p>
                  <p>In reading and hearing the Law of God, he ſetteth his luſts naked before that ſword of the Spirit, <hi>that they may be hewn by the Prophets, and ſlain by the words of Gods mouth;</hi> He deſires that it may pierce deep to <hi>the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of ſoul and ſpirit, of the joynts and marrow, and to the diſcovering of the thoughts and intents of his heart:</hi> His voice to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, is like the Prophets to his neighbour, <hi>Smite me I pray thee,</hi> and likes him beſt, that in ſmiting wounds his ſin moſt: he approves of that Chirurgion that ſearcheth his wounds throughly, though he put him to pain; he rejoyceth that the Preacher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth to him his errors, that he may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them with Hue and cry till they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and puniſhed, and ſo Gods purſuit of him may be prevented: If the Miniſter give him a bitter pill of reproof, he doth not, like a queaſie ſtomach, favour his malady, and loath his medicine, but takes it down willingly, knowing, that though ſuch things be not toothſom, yet they are wholeſom, and that they muſt be bitter things that breaks the bag of worms in his ſtomach; ſweet things will nouriſh and cheriſh them: He is glad that the word is fire, that thereby his droſs may be conſumed; that it is water, becauſe his heart thereby may be waſhed and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; <hi>He hideth the word in his heart, that he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170410:97"/>may not ſin againſt God,</hi> Pſal. 119.11.</p>
                  <p>He goeth to the Lords Supper, that the blood of his ſins may be ſhed by the blood of the Saviour; <hi>The Croſs of Chriſt is the ſouls armour, and ſins terror;</hi> there is life in it for the death of ſin. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that the faſting ſpittle of a man will kill Serpents; Sure I am, the blood of Chriſt applied by faith, will mortifie ſin, and therefore the Saint frequenteth the Sacrament. He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to it, as <hi>Naaman</hi> to <hi>Jordan,</hi> to be cured of his ſpiritual leproſie; when he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the table of the Lord, and ſeeth (in the bread broken, and the wine poured out) by faith Jeſus Chriſt crucified before his eyes; O how his heart burneth within him, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and indignation againſt his ſins, and in deſires after, and delight in his Redeemer: He beholdeth there the knives of his pride, unbelief, hypocriſie, malice, and the like, all redded in the blood of the Mediator; and now his eyes ſparkle with fire and fury, and his ſoul ſwelleth with wrath and revenge againſt them; were but his hand anſwerable to his heart, I mean his power to his will, he would put ſin to as much pain, make it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as much ſhame, cauſe it to undergo as curſed a death as ever Jeſus Chriſt did. Now this frame of ſpirit, exceedingly pleaſing to the King of Saints; he beſpeaks the ſoul at the Sacrament, as <hi>Herod</hi> did the damſel, <hi>Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee to the half, nay, to the whole of my Kingdom.</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:170410:97"/>The ſoul having before conſulted with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part (for this was a pious plot laid before, onely put off till a convenient day) asketh the head of ſome luſt in a charger; the King ſendeth preſently, commandeth execution, to be done accordingly; The new creature doth now with a joyful heart look up to Heaven, and ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who hath this day avenged me of mine enemy; would to God that all the enemies of my Lord the King, and all that riſe up within me againſt thy Laws, were as that one Luſt!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He alſo withdraweth thoſe things which have fed his ſpiritual diſeaſes, he takes away the fuel, that he may put out the fire; he hates the very cup out of which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly drank his loathſom phyſick; he cuts off thoſe pipes which have ſupplied his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; he avoideth the occaſions of evil; he knoweth that his corrupt heart is gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and therefore, whereſoever he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he is fearful of the leaſt ſpark; <hi>He hateth the garment ſpotted with the fleſh,</hi> Jude 19. He endeavoreth that his raiment may not onely be preſerved from burning, but (as the three childrens) from ſienging: He is a true Dove that doth not only flye from the Hawk, from ſin, but will not ſo much as ſmell of a feather which falleth from the Hawke; he abſtaineth from appearances of evil; he dares not come near the brow of the hill, ſo far is he from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the bottom.

                  <p> Now, Reader, conſider, how is it with thee; haſt thou applied theſe ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to thy ſelf? What ſayſt thou? Is it thy endeavor by every providence, and thy end in every ordinance, to mortifiethy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; to bring thoſe Traytors to execution? Is it thy deſign to cover ſin, or to kill ſin? do'ſt thou pray againſt ſin (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſt he did before his converſion) as one afraid that God ſhould hear thee, and grant the requeſt (not of thy heart, but) of thy lips? or is the death of thy ſins the very deſire of thy ſoul? <hi>an unconverted man may put up many prayers, but no deſires againſt ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An unregenerate perſon fighteth againſt ſin,
<note place="margin">Livy.</note> as the <hi>Athenians</hi> againſt <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> with words rather then with ſwords: Or as ſome that openly proſecute the Law againſt a Malefactor, and yet favor him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand; ſo this man makes a ſhew of purſuing ſin unto the death, accuſing, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning it, witneſſing againſt it in prayer, and deſiring judgement; but inwardly he ſo minceth the matter, taketh off the edge of the evidence againſt it, as one reſolved that it ſhall live: His expreſſions cry out of ſin, as the Jews of Chriſt, Away with it, away with it, 'tis not worthy to live, Let it be crucified; but his affections call with much more ardency, as <hi>Pilate,</hi> Why ſhould it die? what evil hath it done? we finde no fault in it; or at leſt (as <hi>Auſtins</hi> heart) <hi>Not yet, Lord, not yet:</hi> A little longer he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170410:98"/>would willingly laze upon the bed of luſt: <hi>A little more ſlumber, a little more ſteep,</hi> ſaith this ſpiritual ſluggard. Truly, all this ſhew of warring againſt ſin, is but falſe fire, which (you know) can do no execution.</p>
                  <p>Fencers, at a prize, ſometimes ply one another ſo home, and ſtrike ſo hard, that they ſeem to be in earneſt, when they are all the while but in jeſt; their intentions are to pleaſe the people, and thereby to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their profit, by getting a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but not at all to wound one another, at leſt not dangerouſly; a ſlight wound poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may happen. Thus unſanctified men combat with ſin; they ſeem by their praying, reading, hearing, to aim at its death, to be in earneſt, when indeed their intentions are to carry on their own intereſt, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, that however they may raze ſin ſlightly (for their own ends) not to wound it deeply. Friend, I know not, but God knoweth, whether it be thus with thee or no: Doſt thou by civility, by the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of duties, by attendance on ordinances tell the world that thou wouldſt crucifie thy corruptions, when ſuch a thing is not in thy retired thoughts? as <hi>Caligula</hi> with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners diſplayed, battel ranged, trumpets ſounding, ſet his ſouldiers to gather cockles: Or doeſt thou enter the liſt againſt thy luſt, as <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> reckoning to kill, or be killed, reſolving through the help of heaven, the ruine of the <hi>uncircumciſed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine?</hi>

The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil holds them as faſt by this one link as by ten thouſand; As it is with a Rabbits skin, it comes of very well, till it come to the head, and then there is haling and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and much ado before it ſtirs; So the creature may do much at the command of God, but there is old ſtir and pulling, before this ſin be ſeparated from him; if this be once done throughly, the man is converted truly; for nothing but a ſaving work, can cauſe a man to loath that ſin which he loved as himſelf: And therefore an uncoverted perſon will ever be falſe in this. <hi>Jehu</hi> may throw down the idolatry of <hi>Baal,</hi> but not the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel:</hi> The young man in his worldlineſs, <hi>Herod</hi> in his uncleanneſs; <hi>Balaam</hi> in his ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt be excuſed. The converted ſoul is in this moſt careful; as <hi>Craumer,</hi> he will put <hi>that unworthy right hand firſt in the fire, with which by his ſubſcription he had ſo much diſhonoured Chriſt and Religion. Mahomet</hi> the Great,

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170410:101"/>cut off his fair <hi>Irenes</hi> head with his own hands, in whom he had ſo exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, to aſſure his Baſhaws that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promote the publick peace and good then pleaſe and ſatiſfy his own paſſions. The true Chriſtian is a far greater conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and out of love to God and his own Salvation, obtains a more lawful and noble victory over the <hi>Miſtris of his affections:</hi> He knoweth no ſin be it never ſo near or dear to him, worth hazarding the loſs of Gods favour, and his eternall welfare for; And therefore though his ſin be an <hi>Abſolom,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which corrupt nature, like <hi>David</hi> gives a ſpecial charge, <hi>Spare the young man</hi> Abſolom: <hi>Deal gently with him for my ſake:</hi> He ſeeth, like <hi>Joah,</hi> that the way to ſcatter the army of luſts, is to ſlay the General, this commander in cheife; And therefore he reſolveth to make ſure work of him, and for that end takes three darts and ſtrikes him through with them all, when one would have done the deed.</p>
                  <p>Reader, I confeſs I have been much larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this head then I intended; but if thou examine thine heart faithfully and prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by it, thou wilt have no cauſe to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for it; I have read that it was wont to be the way of tryal, whether land belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> by putting toads or ſerpents, or other venemous creatures into it; If they lived there, the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>England;</hi> if they died, to <hi>Ireland:</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:170410:101"/>ſure I am, thou mayſt try whether thou at preſent belongeſt to heaven, or to hell, to a Covenant of Works, or to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, whether thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or unconverted: if venemous luſts do live in thee thou art <hi>Engliſh</hi> land, in a ſtate of nature and wrath; if they die daily in thee, thou art in Chriſt and belongeſt to <hi>the Land of promiſe.</hi> Yet I would not be underſtood as if I meant that Godly men are never overtaken with ſin, or that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption never gets the better of them. For I know, that the pureſt on earth are holy but in part: they are like watermen rowing hard againſt the ſtream of corruption, but through a ſudden and violent blaſt of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they may be driven backward: But obſerve, this is violent againſt their fixed and deliberate reſolutions; their obedience to the law of ſin is forced as to an Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not free as to a liege Lord. <hi>Ahab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſold himſelf to ſin.</hi> 1 King. 21.20. <hi>bat</hi> Paul <hi>was ſold under ſin.

But now the tide is turned, the waters run in another channel; the Lord is exalted in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>as his chiefeſt good;</hi> and in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as <hi>his utmoſt end;</hi> the Law of God
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170410:102"/>is written in the heart, and commented upon in the life; the inward man is of a good conſtitution, and the outward man of a good complexion: Grace is a tendency of the ſoul Godward; his underſtanding knoweth God to be the greateſt good, <hi>John</hi> 17. His will chooſeth him, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons love him, his deſire is after him, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in him, his fear is of him, his truſt is on him his care and endeavor is <hi>to walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleaſing, Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5, 6. &amp; 73.25, 26. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.18. like the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower, he followeth the motion of the Sun of righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now, Reader, try thy ſelf; Art thou alive to God? Doeſt thou take him in Chriſt for thy happineſs, and make him thine end? Is it thy buſineſs and trade to do his will; thy calling and employment to finiſh his work? Is thy heart devoted to his fear, and thy life to his honor? how art thou affected to his word and worſhip? Doſt thou perform duties out of love to God, with complacency in God? It it thy <hi>ment and drink</hi> to obey his precepts? How is thy ſoul raviſhed with the ſweetneſſes of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Art thou <hi>joyful in the houſe of prayer?</hi> Is the <hi>Sabbath thy delight?</hi> Is the Scripture ſweeter to thee then <hi>the honey and the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb?</hi> At the Sacrament, canſt thou <hi>fit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſts ſhadow with great delight, and finde his fruit ſweet unto thy taſte?</hi> Doeſt thou
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170410:103"/>eſteem the <hi>yoke</hi> of thy Saviour <hi>eaſie,</hi> his ſervice liberty, <hi>his wayes wayes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all his paths peace?</hi> Canſt thou ſay, <hi>One day in Gods Courts is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a thouſand elſewhere?</hi> Haſt thou found that <hi>'tis good for thee to draw nigh to God?</hi> If thou wert put to thy choice, hadſt thou rather ſolace thy ſoul with ſenſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, or in communion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Jeſus Chriſt his Son? Examine thine heart; for if thou haſt the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, divine and ſpiritual things will be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and ſo pleaſant to thee: A man whoſe nature is covetous, how exceedingly doth he delight in viewing and feeling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney! as the Roman Emperor would putt off his cloaths and tumble up and down in heaps of ſilver: If a mans nature be proud, how exceedingly pleaſed is he in the cap and the knee, in being flattered and reſpected? it is meat and drink to him (as we ſay) to be reverenced in mens carriage, and honored in their language; men love thoſe things a life, becauſe they ſuit with their natures: So when a man hath a new nature, a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual holy nature, things which are ſpiritual and holy, will be acceptable to him, becauſe they are ſuitable to his nature; the word will be welcom, prayer will be pleaſant, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances will be as ſavory as food to the hungry; the man will <hi>love the habitation of Gods houſe, and the place where Gods honour dwelleth;</hi> though his fleſh be weak, his ſpirit
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170410:103"/>is alwayes willing. He may be weary at a duty (that the wheels of his ſoul ſhould ſo be clog'd with the dirt of infidelity, and make him to drive ſo heavily) but he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver weary of duties; though corruption and Satan now dog him at, and diſturb him in his performances; yet 'tis the comfort of his ſoul, that he now drags them in chains after the triumphant chariot of Grace; and he rejoyceth to think how he ſhall leave the body of death behinde him, at the entrance of his ſoul into the Capitol of Glory: His heart leaps now, when his feet do but creep in the way of obedience: when he goeth to the houſe of God, it is <hi>with the voice of joy, unto the altar of God, yea, his God and excceeding joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatſoever a man doth from an ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed propenſity, he doth it not onely in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, but alſo with alacrity: He delights in it, as the fiſh in the water, as the mole in the earth, it is his proper element; God, and the things of God are his element; He would ſtill be, and live in this element: He delights to know God, to worſhip him, to believe in him, to meditate on him, to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his day, to glorifie his name, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Laws, to view his children; he is never ſo well as when he is <hi>walking with God:</hi> if there were no heaven to prefer the obedient, and no hell to puniſh the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, <hi>yet he would fear the Lord, and delight greatly in his commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, ſpeak, Friend, Art
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170410:104"/>thou liſtleſs and dead to ſpiritual things? are they irkſom and tedious to thee? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the commandments of God are <hi>bonds and cords;</hi> the Sabbath thy toilſom day, not a day of reſt and refreſhment, the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary is thy priſon, the ſervice of God is <hi>ſnuft at by thee, and weariſom to thee;</hi> thou art glad that the duty is done, the day is over, thy conſcience quieted, like a Tenant who is glad his rent is paid to his Landlord, but took no pleaſure in parting with his money; thou rejoyceſt at the end, not at the beginning of thy duty; thou counteſt <hi>Amen</hi> the beſt word in a prayer, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's the fruit of thy faith, but becauſe it puts a period to thy petitions; the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> is the beſt part of Divine Worſhip; thou eſteemeſt no part to be before it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is laſt, and nothing comes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>

It may be thou goeſt to duty as a Bear to the ſtake; it goeth againſt the hair with thee to walk in the way of holineſs, though neceſſity compel thee (ſometimes, or) once or twice a day to take a turn in the path of piety: Conſcience will roar unleſs it may finde reſt in ſome outward performance.</p>
                  <p>Or thou mayſt now and then perceive good company walking in the narrow way
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170410:104"/>which leadeth to life; and ſo, as travellers care not if they go a mile or two out of their way for company, eſpecially if the way be fair and the company pleaſing; ſo thou mayſt go out of thy own way ſometimes, and walk a little with the Saints for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>Reader, be faithful to thy ſoul: A real fire differeth from a painted one by its heat; and ſo doth the real from the painted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by his heat, life and delight in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. If thou art alive to God, thou art given up to all the Laws of God, <hi>thou exerciſeſt thy ſelf therein to keep a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of offence towards God and men.</hi> If thou art a Chriſtian indeed, the image of God is imprinted on thee; now this image conſiſteth in knowledge, righteouſneſs and true holineſs: Righteouſneſs conforms thy heart to the whole Second Table of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; Holineſs conforms it to the whole firſt Table, and Knowledge compleats this conformity to both. The regenerate man is not maimed, no part of the new man is wanting: He cuts not off the garments of holineſs in the midſt. <hi>Agrippa</hi> may be <hi>half a Chriſtian, Herod</hi> may do <hi>many things;</hi> but <hi>Zacharias and Elizabeth walk in all the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and ordinances of the Lord, blameleſs:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> will fulfil all the wills of God: <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. Perfect holineſs is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Saints in heaven, but tis the deſire and endeavour of the Saints on earth;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170410:105"/>
                     <hi>O that my ways were directed to keep thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments!</hi> As a reſolved Traveller that is upon a journey of neceſſity, whether the way and weather be fair or foul, he goeth on, <hi>by honor and diſhonour, by evil report and good report, until he appear before God in Sion.</hi> He lifteth at the latch when he cannot open the door; <hi>he hath reſpect to all Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> He obeyeth every Law of both Tables in his will, though he break the Law of both Tables in his works. As the hearts and wills of the <hi>Athenians</hi> were with <hi>Sylla</hi> without the walls, when they were (beſieged by him, and) kept, in their bodies, within by force: So the Saints are with the whole Law in their hearts and intentions, even then when they are forced to fail, in regard of their hands and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Pauls</hi> three adverbs ſpeak a ſubſtantial Chriſtian, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.</p>
                  <p>Some are firſt Table-men, zealous for Religion and duties towards God, but cold and careleſs in point of righteouſneſs and juſtice in their dealings with men. Others are Second Table-men, very juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards men, yet mind not Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; but the true Chriſtian is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in all the will of God,</hi> Phil. 4.12. Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grality is the true note of integrity. The Philoſopher ſayth,

                  <p> An Hypocrite is like ſome books of little worth, becauſe they are imperfect, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting; thoſe commands which will ſuit with his ends ſhall be taken in his way, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did the precepts which enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the rooting out of <hi>Ahabs</hi> family, but thoſe which croſs his deſigns muſt be caſt by as that precept to <hi>Jehu,</hi> of rooting out the Idolatry at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> Thus this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted perſon indents with God, as ſome ſervants with their Maſters, This work he will do, and this work he will not do; and thus while he breaks one command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, he breakes all reductively. The commands of the Law are all copulative, they hang together like a carcanet of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He that breaks one with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and confidence, obeyeth none out of conſcience. He that diſobeyeth God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in one command, ſhall find that he diſobeyeth God wholly in all. <hi>He that keepeth the whole Law, and offendeth in one point, is guilty of all.

                  <p>Reader, If thou ſhouldſt ſit at table and ſee a man pidling at his meat, picking and chuſing, this he liked, that he diſliked, thou wouldeſt conclude, ſurely ſome ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are predominant in him, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is unſound. So when thou art pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the table of the Word, picking and chuſing among the commands of God, this
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170410:106"/>thou likeſt, it is eaſie; that thou diſlikeſt, it will coſt thee ſome pains, or tend to thy diſcredit: Mayſt thou not gather that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is too much prevailing in thee, and thy ſoul is unſound? Be it known unto thee that thou art a Traytor againſt the King of heaven, if thon clippeſt or refuſeſt any piece which hath his impreſſion and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Examine thy ſelf by the Effects of regeneration. I ſhall name three Effects of it, by which I would requeſt thee to ſearch and try thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The new born childe deſireth and ſavoureth the means of grace. The uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted man being dead ſpiritually, hath no appetite to, nor taſte of ſpiritual food; but the living childe hath both; <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. The babe of Grace as ſoon as born, doth cry for the breſt: He can no more live in his ſoul without duties, then in his body without diet. The infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir preferreth his milk before his largeſt Manors: A famine of the word pincheth and paineth him more then a famine of bread and water: <hi>Davids</hi> baniſhment from the Temple was his foreſt trouble, and a far greater affliction to him then his forced ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from his deareſt relations.</p>
                  <p>O the hunger of this gracious ſoul after Scripture! <hi>I opened my mouth and panted, for I longed for thy commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.131.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170410:106"/>The big-bellied mother doth not long more then this new born childe: The poor priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth not beg more heartily for bread, then he for ſpiritual food, <hi>Pſal</hi> 42.1, 2. and 63.1.2.

                        </gap> New heart.</note> A Divine obſerveth excellently on that fore-quoted place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difference between the bad and good in their deſires of the Word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The regenerate deſires the Word as the babe doth milk: How is that? he deſires it as his livelihood when he is <hi>new born</hi> though afterward he is more playful, and every noiſe may call him off from the breaſt; but when new born, nothing can ſatisfie but the breaſt; ſo an hypocrite may deſire the word when there is nothing to call him; but when the world and the word come in competition, he will follow his earthly, whatever become of his heavenly buſineſs; but a new born childe prefers it before thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of gold or ſilver.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The new born childe deſires the word in its plainneſs, <hi>The ſincere milk of the word,</hi> without mixture, as the childe deſires the mothers milk without ſugar; whereas an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other deſires the word in its gaudy dreſs, lofty language, partly out of pride ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſimplicity of the Goſpel; partly out of cowardize, becauſe the naked ſword of the word, drawn out of its gaudy ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, pierceth deepeſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The new born creature deſires the word for a good end, <hi>That he may grow
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170410:107"/>thereby</hi> in grace and holineſs; another man may deſire it that he may grow in ability to diſcourſe, or the like; but this man that he may grow in faith, love, and ſanctifying graces. Beſides, hunger being his ſauce, makes the word ſweet to him, <hi>he eſteemeth the word of Gods mouth more then his appointed food,</hi> Job 23.12. Mark, not then varieties, or ſuperfluous fare, but then daily &amp; neceſſary food; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer might be ſpared, but this for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life is neceſſarily required; but Gods word was before this, Spiritual dainties are moſt delightful to them that have ſpecial grace. And truly 'tis no wonder that the childe doth ſo exceedingly long for and love that which is (as it were) his father, <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for by them thou haſt quickened me,</hi> Pſal. 119.93. Some men ſay they ſhall never forget ſuch a friend the longeſt day that they have to live: What's the reaſon? they will tell us they were nigh death either by fire, or water, or ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and under God, ſuch men ſaved their lives; ſo ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Ile never forget Gods Law the longeſt day I ſhall live: why? what's the matter? Alas, I was nigh death, next door to eternal damnation; there was but a thin paper-wall of life between me and everlaſting wo, and under God the Word helped me, it ſaved my ſoul. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou haſt quickened me.</hi> If <hi>Alexander</hi> could ſay, That he was more bound to his Tutor
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170410:107"/>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> then to his Father <hi>Philip;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had only his being from the latter, when he had his well-being from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and therefore he prized him ſo much: How much therefore doth the true Chriſtian value that word which is inſtrumental to his being in Chriſt here, and his everlaſting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being with Chriſt hereafter?</p>
                  <p>So for prayer, the regenerate perſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without it, and fellowſhip with God in it: He is like a full veſſel (his heart filled with complaints againſt ſin, with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after Chriſt and his likeneſs) if you will not give it vent, 'twill burſt. Prayer is his breathing Godward; without breathing the body could not live, it would be inflamed and burnt up with the heat of its own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails; no more could the ſoul, unleſs the Saint ſhould breath often towards heaven, crying, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> Spiritual breath was the firſt ſign of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpiritual birth, <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> Act. 9.11.</p>
                  <p>So I might ſpeak of other Ordinances of God; for there is a conſtant trade driven between the Convert and heaven, which is carried on by ſeveral commodities; and if this commerce were broken off, he could not ſubſiſt: He findeth the means of grace as needful to keep grace and ſoul together, as meat to keep life and ſoul together: his heart, though fired with this ſpiritual life, is like green wood which will burn no longer then its blown with the bellows of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:170410:108"/>
                  <p> Reader, How doſt thou find thine appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite unto the bread and water of life? doſt thou hunger after the Word, Prayer, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Commonion of Saints, and the Lords day? canſt thou feed on them with delight? doſt thou riſe from Table with an appetite, longing to ſit down again? Canſt thou lay as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I watch, and am as the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon the houſe top?</hi> Pſal. 102.7. Obſerve, the Sparrow upon the top of an houſe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this ſide and that ſide of the houſe, it looketh this way and that way, and round about if he can ſpy any corn, and food; and when it can ſee any, it flieth to that place, and pecks it up; ſo, doſt thou watch for, and reſort to the Ordinances of God which are the food of thy ſoul? what ſayſt thou? It may be thou art for high language, orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical expreſſions; ſuch Sermons only are pleaſing to thee; the diſh muſt be ſet out with many flowers, on which thou lookeſt more then at the meat. Believe it, as there is no greater ſign of a foul ſtomack then to loath ſolid meat, and to pick ſallats, or feed on aſhes; ſo there is hardlier a greater ſign of an unſanctified heart, then to loath the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid food of the word, and to pick the flowers of mans wiſdom in a Sermon, or to feed on the world.</p>
                  <p>Or poſſibly thou art one of the new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled opinioniſts of our unhappy times that are above Ordinances. I muſt tell thee, That to live above Ordinances, is to live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170410:108"/>a Saint. He that doth not reckon the means of Grace his greateſt priviledge on this ſide the place of Glory, may well queſtion whether ever he enjoyed God in them: methinks the begger ſhould know that door again at which he had a large alms, a full bait, <hi>James</hi> 1.18, 19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. A childe indeed may forbear his meat either in a fit of ſullenneſs, or under ſome diſeaſe; but if he be a childe, his dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged fit will be over, he will get the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of his diſtemper, and fall to his food again.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The new-born creature grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Grace; the picture of a childe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but a living childe doth: After ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration followeth augmentation; the ſame word which breeds the new man, feeds him, and enables him <hi>to grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. As the ſame blood, of which the babe is bred in the womb, ſtrikes up into the mothers breaſts, and by a further concoction becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth milk, and ſo nouriſheth it: The good ſeed of the word falling into the foil of an honeſt heart, makes it <hi>abundant in the work of the Lord: Common Grace,</hi> ſometimes like <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s <hi>Sun,</hi> ſtandeth ſtill; but uſually like the <hi>dial of Ahaz,</hi> it goeth ten degrees backward; when <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> like the <hi>morning light, ſhineth brighter and brighter to perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. Firſt, the blade, next, the ear, then the full corn: firſt, they who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God, become <hi>little children,</hi> next
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170410:109"/>
                     <hi>young men,</hi> then <hi>old men</hi> and <hi>fathers,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>The unfound Chriſtian, is like the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> daily uſe, which did corrupt and putrifie; or like a pond of water which quickly drieth up; when true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as the <hi>Manna</hi> in the <hi>Ark,</hi> doth keep ſweet, and as <hi>the waters of the Sanctuary</hi> is up firſt <hi>to the ankles,</hi> then to the <hi>knees,</hi> then to the <hi>loyns,</hi> and at laſt became <hi>a River</hi> ſo deep that none could paſs over it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>If Grace be true, there is a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in it to growth, as there is in ſeed caſt into the earth: There is vertually in a little plant, the bigneſs and height of a great tree, towards which it is putting forth it ſelf with more and more ſtrength every day. So there is in that ſeed of Grace planted in the ſoul at converſion, vertually that perfection of grace which Chriſt hath appointed that man unto, towards which its putting it ſelf forth every day. <hi>He that hath clean hands, groweth ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job 17.9. <hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength till they appear before God in Sion,</hi> Pſal 84. This River of living waters runneth along (notwithſtanding many turnings and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) till it empty it ſelf into the Ocean, and grace commence glory.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>grain of muſtard-ſeed</hi> groweth into a tree, and the ſmoaking flax is blown into a flame: The leaſt ſpark of true holineſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170410:109"/>be put out by all the blaſts of men and devils; but will like the coal-fire wax the hotter for the waters of oppoſition, and never leave aſpiring till it be joyned, and become a pure and perfect flame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He was never good man that mends not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hal <hi>medit. and vows p.</hi> 7. <hi>medit.</hi> 44.</note> (ſaith that holy Biſhop) <hi>for if he were good, he muſt needs deſire to be better; Grace is ſo ſweet, that whoever taſtes of it, muſt needs long after more; and if he deſire it, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it; and if he do but endeavour, God will crown with ſucceſs. Gods family admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of no dwarfs, which are unthriving, and ſtand at a ſtay, but men of meaſures: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever become of my body, or my eſtate, I will ever labour to finde ſomewhat added to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The children of God are therfore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to trees, which are thriving and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, as to the fruitful <hi>vine,</hi> the fat <hi>olive,</hi> the ſeaſonable <hi>ſapling</hi> planted by the Rivers of waters; for he abideth in Chriſt; and whoſoever <hi>abideth in him bringeth forth fruit,</hi> John 15.4. The branch which ſeemeth to belong to the vine (by hanging on it) yet is dead, will wither and periſh; but that which is alive in the vine will partake of its ſap, and thereby thrive and flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>Indeed all Chriſts Scholars are not of the ſame form. All gracious men are not of the ſame growth: as in the natural body, ſome parts have more beauty and ſtrength then others; ſo in the myſtical body of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170410:110"/>Chriſt, one member may be more eminent in ſpiritual ſtrength then another: God doth not give Grace as he did <hi>Manna,</hi> by the <hi>homer; one ſtar differeth from another in glory:</hi> but though all the children of God are not of the ſame ſtrength and ſtature, yet they are all thriving children; and as ſome write of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> they grow while thy live: As all pieces of land are not alike fruitful, ſome bring forth thirty, ſome ſixty, ſome an hundred fold; but all the good grounds are fruitful, and return the ſeed with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, every one bringeth forth ſome fruit.</p>
                  <p>It is confeſt alſo, that a true Chriſtian doth not grow at all times alike; A violent winde may force thoſe waves for ſome time backward, whoſe natural motion is forward. Natures retraction of it ſelf from a viſible fear, upon a ſenſible danger, may make the pulſe of a Chriſtian (that beats truly and ſtrongly in the main point, the ſtate of the ſoul) to intermit and faulter at ſuch a time. <hi>Peter</hi> was far from thriving when he denied his Maſter; firſt, with bare words, and then with curſes and oathes: And ſo was <hi>David</hi> from growing, when he firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits adultery in perſon, and afterwards murder by a proxie: But mark, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under a fit of ſickneſs, grow not at preſent, but after their recovery ſhoot up the more for it: and as trees ſtand at a ſtay in winter, but in ſpring ſhoot forth to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170410:110"/>ſo the childe of God, though he may have his declenſions, yet afterwards he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himſelf, and his diſtemper being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he falls to his food, and gets ſtrength apace; nay, the greater his fall was, the greater his riſe; the lower the ebb and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the higher the tide and increaſe; as we ſee in <hi>Peter,</hi> who though he denied Chriſt out of cowardize,
<note place="margin">Euſeb.</note> came afterwards to own him with courage, and that to the loſs, not onely of his liberty, but his very life: And <hi>David,</hi> who could once imbrue his hands in another mans blood, would not afterwards drink of that water, the fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which had but endangered blood.</p>
                  <p>Reader, How doeſt thou find thine heart to thrive in holineſs? doeſt thou like a dead ſtake in an hedge grow, but it is every day more rotten? or, doeſt thou like a living tree grow bigger and better, extending in the branches, and increaſing in fruit from the ſap which thou deriveſt from Chriſt thy root? Art thou like thoſe Seducers which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, that <hi>grow worſe and worſe;</hi> like a carkaſs, more unſavory every hour then other? or, doſt thou like the moon, alwayes increaſe in the <hi>light</hi> of purity till thou come to the <hi>Full</hi> of Glory? Art thou ever <hi>preſſing forward towards the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt? Or doeſt thou ſlide backward with a perpetual backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?</hi> Art thou one of them that boaſt they are ſtill the ſame, as looſe, as deboiſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170410:111"/>as ever, no changling unleſs it be from one lewd company or looſe courſe to another? like the <hi>Camelion,</hi> thou canſt turn into any colour but white; into any thing but what thou ſhouldſt be: truly, thou art <hi>far from the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Friend, Let conſcience ſpeak, Was the time with thee, when thou couldſt not ſuffer half a day to paſs without duties; nor a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without communion with God in it? thou didſt conſtantly either meet God, or miſs God in an ordinance: thou couldſt not hear an oath, but thou waſt ſenſible of Gods diſhonor, nor ſpeak an idle word, but thou waſt fearful of divine diſpleaſure: God and thy ſoul like two intimate friends did <hi>walk together.</hi> And is it now otherwiſe? canſt thou neglect prayer and the word, and never be troubled at their want? or if thou minde any performance, art thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether or no God affords his preſence? Canſt thou hear others laſh out with their lips, and give thy ſelf liberty for vain and frothy language, yet none of theſe things move thee? O Friend, conſider <hi>whence thou art faln, and repent, and do thy firſt works:</hi> for ſurely 'tis ſad to ſee the dayes grow ſhorter and ſhorter, to ſee a body waſting away every day more and more of a conſumption: And how ſad is it to ſee a ſoul declining in regard of ſpiritual ſtrength! If thou fall forward, thou mayſt help thy ſelf; but if thou fall backward, as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170410:111"/>
                     <hi>old Eli did,</hi> thou mayſt undo thy ſelf; thy fall may prove thy downfall. Remember, that a veſſel of true gold will wear brighter and brighter to the laſt; when a cup which is onely gilt will grow paler and paler, till all the gilt be of: Take heed thou be not like an apple, fair in the outſide, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at coar; for then thou wilt corrupt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and farther, till thy outſide be like thine inſide, and God diſcover thee to be unſound all over.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the new-born creature endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voreth to make others gracious. All living creatures have a tendency and inclination to beget others, and propagate their own kinde. <hi>Adam</hi> when polluted, begets a ſon after his image; truly, ſo doth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian (in his deſires and endeavours) as ſoon as he is purified. No ſanctified ſoul did never make a <hi>Monopoly</hi> of his Saviour; like the wall, he receiveth warmth from the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and reflecteth it on them that are near him.</p>
                  <p>An Hypocrite, who hath no true grace himſelf, careth not how little others have: He is like a dead coal, whatever be nigh him is never warmed or quickned by him; but the ſincere ſoul wiſheth, <hi>that all were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he is;</hi> and as a live coal he kindleth others.</p>
                  <p>All good is diffuſive of it ſelf, and the more of goodneſs in any, the more of diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs. If <hi>Peter</hi> be converted, he will
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170410:112"/>
                     <hi>ſtrengthen his brethren;</hi> if <hi>David</hi> be reduced, <hi>he will teach ſinners Gods ways:</hi> None are more deſirous of children then they who have God for their Father.</p>
                  <p>The true Chriſtian that hath taſted God to be gracious, and found good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his table, cannot but commend his houſ-keeping to others, and adviſe them to accept of the ſame chear.</p>
                  <p>As the ſun refreſheth many with his warm rays, eſpecially them that are near it; ſo doth the Saint benefit many by his fervent prayers for them, occaſional counſels and conſtant pattern to them, but eſpecially thoſe that are of his own family. There indeed are his moſt cheriſhing beams, and enlivening influences. O how diligent is he that the <hi>King of Saints</hi> may have his throne in every heart within his houſe! Like the Bee, he goeth to the flower of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to the flower of that Ordinance, ſucking ſome honey, ſome ſoul-ſweetneſs, and then carrieth all home to his hive, to his family: He will ſtudy and ſtrive that his cottage may become a Church, his houſe Gods leſſer heaven: 'Tis a mercy to be his Wife, he will labor that Chriſt may be her Husband: 'Tis an happineſs to be his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he will endeavour that God may be their Father: 'Tis a priviledge to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, he will do his utmoſt that ſuch may be heirs of ſalvation. His houſe is an health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful air for the ſouls of others to breathe in.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:170410:112"/>
                  <p> Grace like fire cannot be hid; you may as ſoon conceal musk in your hand, as grace in your heart. The turning of a ſinner from evil to good, is like the turning of a bell from one ſide to another which reporteth its own motion. The Convert is reſolved, (as <hi>Elijah</hi>) <hi>to ſhew himſelf,</hi> and in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, in bringing more cuſtomers to that ſhop, where he had ſuch cheap and kind uſage.</p>
                  <p>The Devil was no ſooner fallen, but he laboured to draw man to the ſame wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wretchedneſs with himſelf; the dead in ſin are no ſooner raiſed to ſpiritual life, but they endeavour to draw others to the ſame holineſs and happineſs with themſelves; <hi>Theſe things I write unto you that ye may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip</hi> (which is the only good fellowſhip) <hi>is with the Father and Jeſus Chriſt his Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3.</p>
                  <p>The childe of God <hi>cateth not his morſel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> but loveth company; he is very cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to make Proſelites unto Chriſt. We have a ſaying, That he was unworthy to be born, by whom another is not born: Sure I am, he may queſtion whether he were ever <hi>born again</hi> that doth not labour that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be ſo alſo.</p>
                  <p>Reader, Try thy ſelf by this touchſtone; art thou an heavenly Merchant to ingroſs ſpiritual commodities to thy ſelf? or art thou deſirous that others ſhould ſhare with thee? Is the voyce of thy heart like <hi>Cains?
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170410:113"/>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> or like <hi>Moſes, Would God that all the Lords people were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them?</hi> Canſt thou ſtand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Reader.
<note place="margin">Credo, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, vera fide, etſi languida fide. Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampad.</note> It is far from my thoughts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own or diſcourage the leaſt degree of grace. I know that the Embryo in the womb is reckoned towards a childe; the break of day a part of the day: A palſie, ſhaking hand is a true hand, and may receive a jewel as ſurely, though not ſo ſteadily as another hand: A weak hand of Faith is a true faith, and may receive the pearl of price as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though not ſo chearfully, as a ſtrong Faith. If thy deſires after theſe particulars be ſincere and accompanied with ſuitable endeavours, it will ſpeak much for thee: I am not bringing thy graces to the ballance to weigh them, that I may know their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170410:113"/>and degrees, and how rich thou art; but to the touchſtone, to try them that thou mighteſt know their quality and truth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art poor in ſpirituals, or poor in ſpirit; whether thou art worth any thing or nothing, for thine endleſs eſtate in the other world.</p>
                  <p>To ſum up this Uſe, I would requeſt thee to be ſo great a friend to thy precious ſoul, as to be impartial and faithful in its ſearch and trial. Look much at the conſtant bent and inclination of thy heart: One act will not ſpeak an habit; nor a few good or bad motions, an holy or evil heart. Thou mayſt have ſome <hi>cogitations</hi> of heaven, when thy <hi>converſation</hi> is not in heaven. The <hi>air</hi> is <hi>light,</hi> yet not a lightſom body, becauſe it's lighted by the preſence of another; when that is removed, its dark, as in the night: So if thy light of holineſs in any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned particulars, be only like a flaſh of lightning, for a fit, it is a ſign the <hi>root of the matter is not in thee.</hi> On the other ſide, thou mayſt have <hi>fleſh in thee,</hi> and yet thou not be <hi>in the fleſh.</hi> Thou mayſt be in the right way to heaven, though thou art ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtopt and hindered in thy journey. A ſtream or vent of a river may be to go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yet the River may be dammed up for a while, but 'twill riſe higher and higher, and at length beat down and overcome that which hindereth it; ſo if the tendency of thine inward man, its ordinary frame and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170410:114"/>temper be but towards God and the Divine nature, be not diſcouraged, though there may be the mud of corruption to ſtop the ſtream; for this living water of grace, will be ſo beating upon it, that twill over-power it, and ride triumphantly over it. But be ſure that thou bring the matter in debate to an iſſue, by no means deſiſt till thou bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it to ſome reſult. If Satan can but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee either to daub about it (for his his ſpeech will be like that of <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, pity thy ſelf</hi>) or to leave the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtill in doubt, he knoweth that he ſhall ſpoil the working of all this Phyſick, be it never ſo good. I know that thine heart will be as hard to be kept to it, as an eel in thine hands; therefore ſerve thine heart, as the Judge ſerveth the Jurors at an Aſſize. Firſt, they are ſworn to be true and faithful in deciding and determining the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween party and party: next, they hear the evidence and proofs on both ſides: After that they are ſhut up together, and have neither fire, nor candle, nor bread, nor drink allowed them, till they are agreed on their verdict, which when they have done they bring it into the Court, and there 'tis entred and recorded. <hi>Go thou and do likewiſe:</hi> when thou art got into thy chamber, firſt make thine heart to engage and promiſe before <hi>the Judge of the whole earth,</hi> that it will, through the ſtrength of Chriſt, be true and faithful in determining this weighty contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170410:114"/>between God and thy ſoul, <hi>Whether the land of promiſe belong to thee or not;</hi> next let conſcience be called (which is as ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes) and ſpeak what it knoweth, of thy right and title to that eſtate accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the known Laws of the Lord; and if thou loveſt the life of thy ſoul, do not wink upon that witneſs, or fee him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to make him to mince the matter, and be partial in his teſtimony. <hi>Fooliſh pity here, is ſoul-damning cruelty;</hi> but tell him, he is upon his oath, and in the preſence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God, and charge him to ſpeak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. O do but give conſcience leave to be faithful at this time, and twill be thy friend to eternity: When the evidence is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, let nothing hinder a verdict; call upon thy heart again and again, whether it be reſolved for thee or againſt thee; till this be done, give thy ſelf no reſt: if one day will not ſerve, take two; never give over till it come to an iſſue one way or other. Of what infinite concernment is this to thee, when all that thou art worth for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world dependeth on it!

Aſſure thy ſelf, that all thy Friends and Lands, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and pleaſures; yea, all the help which this whole world can afford thee, cannot keep thee one quarter of an hour out of Hell.</p>
                  <p>This Law, this ſtanding Law of Heaven, <hi>That except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> is like the Law of the <hi>Medes and Perſians, which cannot be altered;</hi> By their Law, <hi>That which was written in the Kings Name, and ſealed with the Kings ſeal, might no man reverſe,</hi> Eſth. 8.8.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170410:116"/>(and I would ſpeak it with reverence to the higheſt Majeſty) that God himſelf cannot do it. 'Tis his perfection, that <hi>it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to lye,</hi> Tit. 1.2. His hand cannot but make good, what his mouth hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. His will and word have joyned rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration and ſalvation together, and his faithfulneſs and truth will not ſuffer them to be parted aſunder. Therefore think of it timely, and turn to God truly; otherwiſe there is a neceſſity of thy periſhing ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly.</p>
                  <p>Thou doeſt not know, as ſtrong and luſty as thou art, how ſoon death may come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde thee, and throw thee; and, O 'twill be thine eternal overthrow: though, as on <hi>Sodom,</hi> thy morning be Sunſhiny; yet thou canſt not tell how ſoon it may overcaſt; nay, it may be followed with flakes of fire before night. Sure I am, that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee no leaſe of thy life, and that others have died of the ſame age and likelineſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; and why thou ſhouldſt promiſe thy ſelf a priviledge beyond others, that thou ſhalt live longer, I know no reaſon, unleſs this, That the Devil and thine own heart have conſpired together to murther thy ſoul, by getting thee to future, and put off thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion till thou comeſt to Hell-fire, and then thy ruine will be paſt remedy. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame voice ſhould come to thee which did to <hi>Hezekiah; Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not live:</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170410:117"/>ſpeedily) What woulſt thou do? thy houſe is not in order; thy ſoul, <hi>Man,</hi> is all out of order, and therefore death would come to thee, as <hi>Abijah</hi> to <hi>Jeroboams</hi> wife, <hi>with heavy tidings,</hi> with ſuch news as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> brought to <hi>Eli,</hi> which will make thy ears to tingle, and thine heart to tremble. <hi>Ah, how will he do to die, that never knew how to live!</hi> The black Uſher of death will go before, and the flaming fire of Hell will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after. Didſt thou but believe the word of God as much as the Devils do, thou couldſt never depart this life in thy wits, who haſt not led thy life according to Gods will.</p>
                  <p>One would think, the noiſe of this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering piece, of this great Cannon, <hi>Death,</hi> (though it ſhould not be very near thee) might awaken and affrighten thee: when that deluge of wrath cometh, that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of fury from below is broken up, and the flakes of fire from above are rained down, thou haſt no Ark, no Promiſe, no Chriſt to ſhelter thy ſelf in: For Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the plank caſt out by God himſelf, to ſave the ſinking ſinner, by bringing him to the Lord Jeſus, and thou wanteſt it. Doſt thou not ſee that thy Sentence of death (if thou continueſt ſo) is already paſſed in the High-Court of Heaven, entred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſt in the Book of Scripture! and God knoweth how ſoon the word of command may be given to ſome diſeaſe for thy execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p> What comfort therefore canſt thou take in all the creatures, while thou wanteſt this new creation? It is reported of <hi>Xerxes,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, ſuch a voice might mar thy greateſt mirth, ſauce every diſh with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, make thy moſt delicate meat a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and thy ſweeteſt drink diſtaſtful to thee. O, didſt thou but know what it is to loſe thy ſoul, thy God, thy Chriſt, thine Heaven, and all for ever; thou wouldſt in the night be ſcared with dreams and viſions, and in the day be frighted with fears and terrors.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was bid by <hi>David</hi> to go down to his houſe and refreſh himſelf; he anſwered, <hi>The Ark, and</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>abide in Tents, and my Lord</hi> Joab, <hi>and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of my Lord are encamped in the open fields: ſhall I then go into mine houſe to eat and drink and lie with my wife! As thou liveſt, and as thy ſoul liveth, I will not do this thing.</hi> 2 Sam. 11.11. Mark, The good man could
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170410:118"/>take no pleaſure in relations or poſſeſſions, becauſe the natural lives of others were in danger; nay, he forſwears the uſe of thoſe comforts for that very cauſe. How then canſt thou ſolace thy ſelf with lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, when thine Eternal life is (not in jeopardy, but) loſt really, and thou canſt not aſſure thy ſelf one day for its reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very!</p>
                  <p>Shouldſt thou ſee a condemned priſoner (which knoweth not whether he ſhall be hanged on the morrow, or the day after) hawking or hunting, ſprucing himſelf, or ſporting with his jovial companions; what thoughts wouldſt thou have of ſuch a man? wouldſt thou not think, ſurely this man is mad, or deſperate! were he not beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he would minde ſomewhat elſe, ſince he is ſo near his end. But, Friend, turn thine eyes inward, and ſee whether there is not infinitely more reaſon, why thou ſhouldſt wonder at thine own folly and madneſs, who art by the word of the dreadful God condemned, not to be <hi>hanged,</hi> but to be <hi>damned;</hi> not to the gallows, but to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire, and canſt not tell whether this night, or to morrow morning juſtice ſhall be done upon thee, and yet thou art buying and ſelling, eating and drinking, pampering the periſhing body, never mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or thinking what ſhall become of thy poor precious ſoul to eternity!</p>
                  <p>The wiſe mans advice is, that if thou art

What ſpeed ſhouldſt thou then uſe, when thou art infinitely indebted to the <hi>Almighty God</hi> (at his mercy every moment, liable continually to be arreſted by that ſurly Serjeant <hi>Death,</hi> and by him to be hurried into the dark priſon of Hell) to <hi>agree with thine Adverſary while thou art in the way;</hi> and to get the black lines of thy ſins croſt with the red lines of Chriſts blood, and ſo for ever blotted out of the Book of Gods remembrance! As the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain of one of the <hi>Perſian Princes</hi> uſed to ſay to him every morning, <hi>Ariſe, my Lord, and have regard to the weighty affairs for which the great God would have you to provide.</hi> So ſay I to thee, Awake, O man, out of thy carnal ſecurity, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the great end, for which thou waſt born, and the great errand for which the great God hath ſent thee into the world.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>

A ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the evil and end of thy way, were a cheap prevention of eternal and endleſs wo. Obſerve I ſay, <hi>Conſideration; Conſideration is, an Act of the practical underſtanding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it reflecteth upon its actions and intentions, and comparing them with the rule of the word, proceedeth to lay its command upon the will and affections, to put what is good in execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was hinted by <hi>chewing the cud,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170410:119"/>the law; and the beaſts which did not, were unclean; and indeed it is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a man above a beaſt, that he may in a rational diſcurſive manner, meditate on things which concern his ſalvation, and by chewing the cud, get ſome nouriſhment to his ſoul. <hi>It is a pondering the ſayings of Chriſt, Luke</hi> 2.19. It is to the ſoul what digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to the body, tis not the quantity of meat, but a good digeſtion which nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſtrengthneth the body. For they which eat much and cannot digeſt it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of repairing, they ruine nature; ſo 'tis not the great knowledge of the truths of God, but the <hi>ſerious</hi> conſideration and practicall application, of them, which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and ſtrengthneth the ſoul; With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, mens knowledge be it never ſo much, is but like rain in the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or fire in the flint, unprofitable, and to no purpoſe at all.</p>
               <p>I ſay <hi>ſerious conſideration;</hi> The thoughts muſt dwell upon Divine weighty truths; Surely men if they ſhould do thus, would undo all they have done; but when the thoughts of God, and Chriſt, ſin and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, death and judgment, heaven and hell, paſs ſpeedily through them, as travellers through a Country making no ſtay, no wonder if they cannot give any account of the worth and vertue of them. It is not the haſty ſhowre, but ſoft ſnow which ſoaks deep; whilſt the former goeth off as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170410:120"/>faſt as it comes on, the latter gently creeps into every chink of the ground.</p>
               <p>It is with the truths of God, as with a ſalve; if a man have never ſo precious a ſalve, which will help a dangerous mortal wound in twelve houres, and he do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but lay the plaiſter (which is ſpread with this ſalve) on the wound, and take it off preſently, twill never heal the wound; if ever it eat out the corruption and cure the ſore, it muſt lie on ſome conſiderable time together, the beſt ſalve under heaven, will not otherwiſe do the wounded man good. So if a man turn his thoughts upon the loathſom nature of ſin, the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble danger of ſinners, the miſery that he is liable to, whilſt he continueth carnal; the mercy that he might obtain if he were ſpiritual; the alſufficiency of God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of godlineſs, the purchaſe of Chriſt, and the promiſes of the Goſpel, every of which is a precious medicine to cure ſoul maladies; yet if his thoughts do not ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, if they are onely glancing thoughts off and on, like lightening, flaſhing on the conſcience and away, they will never heal thy ſpiritual diſeaſes. That meſſenger which would diſpatch buſineſs of weight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, muſt not call at a door, and then be gon, but he muſt go in, ſit down, and make ſome ſtay there.</p>
               <p>This <hi>ſerious conſideration,</hi> Friend, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to thee as an excellent receipt for
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170410:120"/>the recovery of thy dying ſoul. <hi>I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my wayes,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>and turned my feet to thy teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.59. Some tranſlate the Original, <hi>I looked on both ſides</hi> upon my wayes, I conſidered them every way, <hi>and turned my feet unto thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:</hi> I conſidered that I was wandering like a loſt ſheep, and then I returned unto the fold of God.</p>

The Mariner who is running his veſſel againſt a rock, if he conſider it, and ſteer another courſe, he doth thereby prevent a deſperate ſhipwrack.</p>
               <p>When <hi>David</hi> would ſtop the enemies of God in their full career of wickedneſs, he layeth this block in their way; <hi>Commune with your own hearts, and be ſtill,</hi> Pſal. 4.4.

               <p>I have ſometime read of a religious father, that had a deboyſt lewd ſon, that was a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170410:122"/>great grief to him; when the father was on his death bed, he made this ſon to promiſe him, that he would be every day of his life, half an hour alone by himſelf. The ſon making ſome conſcience of his ſolemne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to his dying father, uſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to retire himſelf daily, for that ſpace of time, where at firſt he buſied himſelf vainly, in thinking of the honours and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the world; but afterwards he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider, what end his father had in binding him to ſuch retiredneſs, and then thought of his own folly, in wandring from God, and embracing a dying and lying world; and the Spirit ſtriking in with thoſe meditations, he became a new man. O that, Reader, thou wouldſt go and do <hi>as he did.</hi> Is it not an eaſy remedy? If God ſhould require ten hours, every day, to be ſpent in ſecret, about thy ſoul and ſalvation, I profeſs to thee, I know not how thou couldſt ſpend thy time better, or ſo well. I am ſure twere worth the while; O Friend to be amongſt Divels, in everlaſting torments, or with Chriſt in everlaſting pleaſures, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of things then thou canſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; but I do requeſt of thee, on the behalf of God and thy ſoul, but one half hour eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, that thou wouldſt retire thy ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy chamber, or cloſet. (The beautiful bridegroom is baſhful, and cometh ſeldom to his Church. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11. or any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in a crowd) and there conſider ſeriouſly,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170410:123"/>of ſome things which I ſhall from the Lord propound to thee.

Ah didſt thou but know the price of a Chriſt, thou wouldſt ſell all to buy that pearle; didſt thou but know the wrath of a juſt, holy and infinite God, thou wouldſt do any thing, do all things poſſible to eſcape it. How much rather when I deſire onely one half hour in a day for ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If thou wilt not do this for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hell, doſt thou not deſerve to burn for ever? think of it, Reader, whoever thou art, I am very loath to leave thee before I have prevailed with thee; doſt thou not ſqander away, many an hour vainly, nay ſinfully in working out thy damnation, and wilt thou not ſpare one half hour in a day, to work out thy ſalvation in? how many years haſt thou ſpent in the ſervice of thy
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170410:123"/>brutiſh fleſh, and is half an hour in a day, when thou art not ſure to live a week, too much for thine angelical ſpirit? What ſaiſt thou? Wilt thou promiſe thy Maker and Redeemer, that thou wilt do this; whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is it like to be thine or mine? <hi>If thou art wiſe, thou art wiſe for thy ſelf, but if thou art a ſcorner thou alone ſhalt ſuffer,</hi> Prov. 9.12. Well, if thou wilt not grant me this little time, thou art like to grieve for the refuſal eternally.

If thou lookeſt into Scriptures, there is a table richly ſpread (which they that are born of God ſit at) with Adoption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, peace, love, the purchaſe of Chriſt, the comforts of the Spirit, which thou as the <hi>unbelieving Lord</hi> mayſt ſee, but ſhall not ſo much as taſte of.

Look to it and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou waſt warned of it: For if thou dieſt naturally, before thou liveſt ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, thou dieſt eternally.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170410:145"/>O Reader, hadſt thou ever found at a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what it is to <hi>ſup with Chriſt, and Chriſt with thee,</hi> thou wouldſt ſcorn the life of an Emperor for the life of a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Prayer,</hi> God and thy ſoul would ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſe together. Thy petitions would aſcend up to him, and his righthand-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes would deſcend on thee. In this duty thou wouldſt call, turning his precepts into prayers, and he would anſwer by turning his promiſes into performances. Many many a bleſſing ſhouldſt thou obtain kneeling. This veſſel would never return (though ſomtimes it might ſeem to tarry long) but richly laden. The crop of Gods anſwer, would be far greater then the ſeed of thy prayer, out of which it grew. The Prodigal deſired but <hi>the liberty of a ſervant,</hi> but the Father beſtowed on him <hi>the dignity of a ſon; the King aſked life, and thou gaveſt it him, yea a length of days for ever and ever, his glory is great in thy Salvation, honour and majeſty, haſt thou put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.

               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:170410:146"/>
               <p> In brief, Chriſt would be thy Shepherd, <hi>feed thee in green paſtures, lead thee by the ſtill waters,</hi> and take care that thou be fat and flouriſhing. As the root ſendeth up its ſap through the bark to all its living branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whereby they continue living, and bring forth fruit; ſo if thou wert but regenerated and a living branch, thou ſhouldſt derive the ſap of grace through ordinances from Chriſt thy root, whereby thou ſhouldſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in ſpiritual life, and glorify God by bringing forth <hi>much fruit.</hi>

               <p>Thus happy, Reader, ſhouldſt thou be, if thou wert once regenerated. That God in compariſon of whom the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as nothing, would be thy God. O how eminently, how infinitely, wouldſt thou be bleſſed, in having ſo rich, ſo
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170410:150"/>vaſt, ſo boundleſs a good for thy God.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhouldſt be <hi>bleſſed</hi> in thy <hi>body,</hi> that ſhould be the <hi>temple of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and part of the myſtical body of the Son of God, and ſo nearly and cloſely united to him, that neither death, grave, nor duſt, ſhould ever be able to ſeparate it from him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14, 16.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhouldſt be <hi>bleſſed</hi> in thy <hi>ſoul,</hi> that ſhould be ever fat and flouriſhing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.13, 14. like a watered Garden abounding in fruit; the ſmell of thy ſoul would be as the ſmell of a field which the Lord hath bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhouldeſt be <hi>bleſſed</hi> in thy <hi>eſtate;</hi> that bleſſing which can turn a Priſon into a Palace, a Cottage into a Court, poverty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plenty, would be thy portion; thou ſhouldſt be ſure of neceſſaries, of enough to bear thy charges till thou comeſt to thy Fathers houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.25, 26. and 34.11. Having faith, thou ſhould not fear a famine, but wouldſt be aſſured that he who feeds the birds of the air, fodders the beaſts of the fields, filleth the bellies of his Enemies with hidden treaſures, would never forget his friends, or ſtarve his children: The Lord would be thy <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and therefore thou couldſt not want, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1. As they that are well lined within, and have much good blood and ſpirits can endure to go in cold weather with leſs clothes then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: So thou being inwardly ſtrengthened
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170410:150"/>with the grace and love of God, ſhouldſt be able to walk in the world comfortably with a leſs eſtate then others; If thou ſhouldſt be thine own carver, thou wouldſt cut thy fingers.</p>
               <p>If thy means were ſmall, thy ſtomach ſhould not be great. As the <hi>ſheep</hi> can live upon <hi>bare Commons,</hi> and thrive there where the <hi>fat Ox</hi> would be ſtarved, ſo in the midſt of thy <hi>ſtraights,</hi> thy <hi>contentedneſs</hi> would give thee a <hi>ſufficiency:</hi> when others who are ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to grace in the midſt of their <hi>ſufficiency</hi> are in <hi>ſtraights, Job</hi> 20.22. True piety hath true plenty, and is never without a well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting ſufficiency, for twill give him who hath nothing the poſſeſſion of <hi>all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Thy <hi>dinner of herbs, with the love and favour of God, would be better then a ſtalled Ox with his anger and frowns. Prov.</hi> 15.15.16.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhouldſt be <hi>bleſſed in thy children. The juſt man walketh in his integrity, and his children are bleſſed after him. Prov.</hi> 20.7. <hi>John's</hi> Children fared the better for their fathers godlyneſs, thoug it were but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.30. Surely then, <hi>The generation of the upright ſhall be bleſſed. Pſal.</hi> 112.2. When thou didſt leave them. God would find them, and require thy children (for thy love to him.) much more faithfully then <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> for <hi>Jonathans</hi> good will. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39.</p>
               <p>Thy whole houſe would be the happier
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170410:151"/>for thee, <hi>God bleſſeth the habitation of the righteous, Prov</hi> 3.33. Nothing can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be wanting, but it may be made up by this bleſſing. <hi>If thou doſt hearken unto the voyce of the Lord thy God, bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the city, and in the field, bleſſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattel. Bleſſed ſhall be thy baſket and thy ſtore, bleſſed ſhalt thou be when thou goeſt out, and bleſſed ſhalt thou be when thou comeſt in. Deut.</hi> 28.1, <hi>to</hi> 14. <hi>verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou wouldſt be a bleſſing to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as a conduite yield clear water for others comfort. If they were prophane, they might be brought to mind piety by thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and pattern. If they were good, they would rejoyce at thy converſion to God, and like <hi>Abraham</hi> make a <hi>feaſt</hi> at the <hi>weaning</hi> of thee <hi>a child of the promiſe</hi> from the breaſts of the creatures.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhouldſt be bleſſed in thy name. <hi>The memory of the juſt is bleſſed, Prov.</hi> 10.7. Thy name would be heir to thy life, as ſoon as ever thy nature were religious, thy name would be reverend, and when thou dieſt thou wouldſt go out (of this world) like ſome ſweet perfume, leaving a fragrant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour behind thee.</p>
               <p>O Reader, how many ſheets might I write, in relating thy felicity! How ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſhouldſt thou be, having blood royal running in thy veins, and being heir apparent to a Kingdom of glory! How rich,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170410:151"/>having a key to Gods treaſury, and being intereſted in the covenant of grace, which hath more wealth in it then heaven and earth! How comfortable, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for thy cordials, and being garriſond within <hi>with that peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding!</hi> How beautiful having the robes of <hi>the righteouſneſs of God</hi> to adorn thee, which is infinitely more comly then the unſpotted innocency, either of <hi>Adam</hi> or Angels! The infinite God would be thy God, bleſſed Angels thy guardians, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Saints thy companions, durable riches thy portion, the fleſh of Chriſt thy food, his own robes thy raiment, and his own manſion houſe thine everlaſting home.</p>
               <p>Thou couldſt not caſt an eye, but it would ſee matter of mirth; nor ſend forth a thought, but it would return with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of mercy. Whether thou lookeſt up to thy father in heaven, and his glorious attendants there, or lookeſt down to his creatures on earth, and the ſigns of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold wiſdom, and mighty power here, or whether thou lookeſt into conſcience or Scriptures, every thing, all things would yeild thee cauſe of comfort, and give thee occaſion of inward exaltation.</p>
               <p>In all conditions, be they never ſo ſad, thy ſoul would be ſafe, and thine everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtate ſecure. The vails are incertain, but the ſtanding wages are certain. What ballaſt is to a ſhip, that regeneration would
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170410:152"/>be to thy ſpirit: If the veſſel be ſound and well ballaſted, though it may be toſſed and rocked with windes and waves, yet it ſhall not be ruined: So if thine heart were <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with grace,</hi> thou ſhouldſt be ſteady in the greateſt ſtorm; nay, though thou wert naked in deep waters, in the mighty Sea, yet Chriſt thine head being ever above wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thou couldſt not poſſibly ſink.</p>
               <p>When thou ſhouldſt come to die, and to <hi>throw thy laſt caſt for Eternity, thou mighteſt walk in the valley of the ſhadow of death and fear none ill, for God would be with thee,</hi> Pſal. 23. When pale-faced death knocks at the door of thine houſe of clay, by the hand of ſome mortal ſickneſs, thou needſt not be daunted at his grim looks, but mighteſt boldly open to him, and bid that Meſſenger heartily welcom, as knowing that he comes from a God in Covenant, to give thee a paſſage into fulneſs of joy and everlaſting pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Its reported of <hi>Godfry</hi> Duke of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loign</hi> in his expedition to the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> that when his Army came within view of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> beholding the high Turrets and fair Fronts (which were the skelitons of far more glorious bodies) they were ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy, that they gave ſuch a ſhout, that the very earth was ſaid to ring again. How might thine heart leap with joy, when thou upon thy death-bed ſhouldſt with the eye of faith behold the ſtately
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170410:152"/>Turrets, and pearly gates of the <hi>New and Eternal Jeruſalem!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou mighteſt contentedly leave thine earthly habitation for the <hi>Fathers houſe,</hi> and joyfully bid adieu to thy corruptible ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and airy honors, for an <hi>enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and an eternal weight of glory.</hi> How cheerfully mighteſt thou forſake thy meat and drink, and all thy carnal comforts, to <hi>eat bread in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and to bathe thy ſoul in angelical delights! With what courage mighteſt thou bid farewel to thy ſtately dwelling, deareſt wife, moſt lovely children, all thy kindred and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to go <hi>to mount Sion, and to the City of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly and Church of the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant!</hi> Hebr. 12.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhouldſt comfortably think of thy bodies being laid in the grave, to ſleep there till the morning of the Reſurrection; for that bed would be ſweet to thee, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with the precious body of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for thee. And with what joy mighteſt thou think of the day of Judgement, when thy body ſhould be awaken out of its ſleep, united to thy ſoul, <hi>faſhioned like unto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body of Chriſt,</hi> and both ſoul and body made perfectly bleſſed, in the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170410:153"/>of God to all eternity. O the felicity of the regenerate! How bleſſed are they whom God chooſeth, and cauſeth by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to approach unto him! Friend, Friend, Can the world do half this for thee? Why then doſt <hi>thou ſpend thy ſtrength for what is not bread, and thy labour for what will not ſatisfie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will not God do all this and much much more for thee! Why then doſt thou <hi>forſake the fountain of living waters, and hew unto thy ſelf broken ciſterns that can hold no waters!</hi> Ah, didſt thou but know the gift of God, and who it is that offereth theſe things to thee, thou wouldeſt ask of him, and he would give thee living waters, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. Reader, what ſayeſt thou to theſe things? Is there not infinite reaſon why thou ſhouldſt ſpeedily give a Bill of divorce to thy moſt beloved luſts, and ſtrike an hearty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Lord Jeſus? Art not thou fully convinced of the matchleſs gain of godlineſs? Let conſcience ſpeak; one would think ſuch powerful arguments could not be denied; that ſo many, and ſuch coſtly Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones ſhould draw thee towards Heaven, though thine heart were as hard as iron or ſteel. If thou art for profit, man, here is profit indeed, and to purpoſe. Thus whilſt thou continueſt in this world, thou ſhouldſt be a bleſſed ſoul.</p>

                  <p>THough in what I have already offered, in the Name of the bleſſed God, I have unſpeakably out-bid Devil, World, and Fleſh; yet to manifeſt thy folly, in making and continuing a League with them, to thine extream and unconceiveable diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I ſhall endeavour to ſet before thee, though briefly, the far greater felicity which thou ſhouldſt obtain in the other World.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And this, Reader, is the <hi>beſt wine</hi> which Chriſt keeps for his Gheſts till the laſt, though how good it is none can tell but they that have taſted it. Truly, what <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> ſaid of <hi>Baſil,</hi> I may ſay of this <hi>glorious Saint; There wants nothing but his own tongue to commend him.</hi> The Subject is large and weighty; and ſure I am, that it would require the words not onely of a Saint, but an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to do it according to its worth. I ſhall onely give thee a ſay briefly, of that which glorified Saints enjoy fully.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thou ſhouldſt know what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holineſs is; if thou wert but new born, this one thought would <hi>fill thy ſoul
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170410:154"/>with marrow and fatneſs,</hi> and cauſe thy <hi>mouth to praiſe God with joyfull lips.</hi> One dram of holineſs infinitely ſurpaſſeth (in the eſteem of a Saint) all the Kingdoms and Empires of this world, how much then is perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs worth? In heaven thou ſhouldſt have it, <hi>There thou ſhouldſt be before the throne without fault, and ſerve him day and night, in his temple, Rev.</hi> 14.5.</p>
                  <p>What price doth a Saint ſet upon, and what pains doth he take for a little holineſs. If thou wouldſt know why <hi>he hideth the word in his heart,</hi> tis that he <hi>might not ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God;</hi> the purging out of ſinful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, is the end for which he takes that phiſick. Why he readeth and heareth ſo diligently, tis that he might be ſanctified through Gods truth; cleanſing is the reaſon why he uſeth that water. Why he prayeth ſo frequently and ſo fervently, tis that he might have a clean heart created, and a right ſpirit renewed within him: Grace is the chief alms, for which he knocks and begs ſo hard, at the beautifull gate of Gods Temple; why he goeth to the ſacrament, tis that he might grow in ſanctity; he goeth to the death of his Saviour, for the death of his ſins; and his great deſign in that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al feaſt is ſo to feed, that he might get ſome more ſpiritual ſtrength. Nay how content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can he be under very ſad croſſes, if they may but make him more like to Chriſt, he can patiently bear the pain of lancing and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170410:154"/>cutting, ſo it may but let out corruption. He can take bitter pills for the removing of inward diſeaſes, and the furthering of his ſouls health, and more willingly <hi>ſpend all</hi> be hath for the cure of <hi>his iſſue of ſin,</hi> then ever the widow did, for the cure of <hi>her iſſue of blood.</hi> Now Reader, thou ſhouldſt have the veſſel of thy ſoul filled with this <hi>water of life.</hi> One drop of which is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as thou haſt heard, to the regenerate. Thou ſhouldſt have a perfection of degrees, as well as of parts, and enjoy ſo much of theſe true riches, that thou ſhouldſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire one grain more. Thou ſhouldſt be a book wherein the image of God ſhould be written, in a fair large print, and there ſhould be no errata's in thee. Sin now is like the Ivy in the wall, cut it never ſo much, yet it will ſprout out again; but as grace mortifieth it here, glory ſhall nullify it in heaven. Wert thou in Chriſt, twould be no ſmall comfort to think the time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming when thou ſhalt never offend God more, never deal unkindly with Chriſt more.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhouldſt by bleſſed experience, know the truth of thoſe Scriptures. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God ſinneth not, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> 1 John 3.9. <hi>Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the word. That he might preſent it to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170410:155"/>himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Epheſ. 5.25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>The body of death, ſhould die with the death of thy body. Thou ſhouldſt not be taken away <hi>in thy ſins,</hi> but <hi>from thy ſins;</hi> It would be impoſſible for thee to ſin there, becauſe of thine happy ſight of God there. Sin is an averſion from God, and converſion to the creature. Now thou ſhouldſt enjoy ſuch ſoul raviſhing ſweetneſs in the bleſſed God, and that ſo fully, that thou couldſt not leave ſo excellent a good for any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thy graces here in their minority, and nonage would be then in their maturity.</p>
                  <p>If that holineſs which is but in part on earth, would be ſo beautiful in thine eyes, that it would raviſh thine heart more then all the glory of this lower world, what would perfect holineſs in heaven be?</p>
                  <p>If the picture or image of God, be ſo comely in its rough draught here below; Ah, how lovely a peice will it be in all its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when Gods <hi>Noviſſima manus</hi> his laſt hand ſhall come upon it above! 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou ſhouldſt know what compleat happineſs is. Thine holineſs and happineſs like twins, would grow up and come to their full age together; thy perfect purity there, would cauſe perfect peace. Thy day of light and gladneſs in heaven,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170410:155"/>could never be overcaſt with the ſmalleſt cloud, becauſe ſins that are the vapours out of which they breed, could not aſcend ſo high. Thy freedom from evil would be full, thy fruition of good would be full, and therefore thy felicity muſt needs be full. Thy body there would be free from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and deformity to which it is liable, and with which it is affected here. The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the firſt, would be corrected in its ſecond edition. <hi>A body of vileneſs ſhall be a body of glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All thoſe miſeries which fright and moleſt thee now, would then forſake thee. No evil durſt arreſt thee, when thou ſhalt walk in the preſence of <hi>Sions</hi> King. In this thou ſhouldſt be like irrational creatures, that thy miſery ſhould end with thy life: And in this reſemble the bleſſed Angels, that thou ſhouldſt alwayes behold the face of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In his preſence is fulneſs of joy.</hi> When the <hi>Sun</hi> beholdeth the <hi>Moon,</hi> with his full aſpect, then the Moon is at the <hi>Full.</hi> In heaven the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> would ever look on thee, with his favourable face, in ſo full a degree that thou ſhouldſt be at the Full of thy light, and happineſs. God is an univerſal good, the ſoul of man hath a kind of an infinite appetite. It deſireth this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that treaſure, and when it hath them, it is like a dropſicall body, as thirſty as ever; for thoſe creatures having but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

                  <p>Thou ſhouldſt ever be at the well-head; and therefore needeſt not fear the leaſt want. Thine appetite there would be ever freſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, and thy ſatisfaction ever ful in God. God would be to thee any thing, every thing, all things which thy heart could poſſibly deſire. God is ſo ſweet and ſatisfying a good to his people on earth, that they have found the loſs of other things abundantly, made up in his favour and love, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16, 17. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. though he communicated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but in ſmall drops, by ſlow degrees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; O then what would God be to thee in heaven, when he would give of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abundantly and continually unto thy ſoul! If all the delightful objects, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which the whole creation here below affordeth, were united into one, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thee, and thou wert to live a thouſand years, in the enjoyment of it, this were not worth one day in Gods courts in this world, much leſs one hour, or one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enjoying him in the other world. <hi>In his preſence is fullneſs of joy, and at his right hand, are pleaſures for evermore. Pſalm.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> Though all words are too weak to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Saints happineſs there, yet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks much in this verſe. For quality there is <hi>joy,</hi> there is <hi>pleaſure;</hi> What canſt thou
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170410:156"/>wiſh which is not contained in thoſe two words? hope of future joy made the <hi>man of ſorrows</hi> contented under his ſhameful and bloody croſs; how comfortable wilt thou be when thou ſhalt have it in hand?</p>
                  <p>For quantity, <hi>fulneſs of joy,</hi> or a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, of which thou ſhouldſt drink full draughts, without interruption or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Thy joy would be pure without mixture, and perfect without meaſure. The <hi>Maſters joy,</hi> or <hi>the joy of thy Lord: In his preſence,</hi> the fruition of God is the faireſt flower in the Garland of Honor, and that alone which gives compleat ſatisfaction to the ſoul: He is the Heaven of Heaven, and other things are but acceſſary to this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, yet other things there would afford comfort, through <hi>the God of conſolation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſights there would pleaſe thine eyes, for thou ſhouldſt behold not onely perfect Saints, but the pearleſs Saviour; <hi>thine eyes ſhould ſee the King in his glory:</hi> there is a great difference between ſeeing a King in his ordinary attire, and on his throne with his robes, and all his ſigns of Majeſty. The ſight of the Saints would much delight thee, to ſee thoſe heirs in the poſſeſſion of their inheritances: When <hi>Cyneas</hi> the Ambaſſador of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> had beheld the ſtate and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the Roman Senators and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was ſo exceedingly taken with it, that at his return from that City of <hi>Rome,</hi> being asked, how he liked it, and what he
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170410:157"/>thought of that ſtate, he anſwered, <hi>That he ſaw as many Emperors as Senators, and that it was a Commonwealth of Kings.</hi> Such would Heaven be to thine eyes, a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Emperors and Kings, wherein every Saint would have a robe of <hi>honour,</hi> a ſcepter of <hi>power,</hi> a throne of <hi>majeſty,</hi> and crown of <hi>glory.</hi> Surely, ſuch ſights would fill thee with wonder and joy, to behold all the children in their Fathers houſe ſo richly clad, ſo daintily feaſted, and ſo highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as they ſhall be there. But O the joy which will poſſeſs thee at the ſight of the Lord Jeſus, who, as the Sun, will ſhine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly indeed in the midſt of thoſe Stars, and as a Judge be known by his robes, from all the Juſtices on the Bench. If it were ſo good to behold him here in his eſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and in his mourning weeds; what will it be to behold him in his eſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, and in his bright, ſparkling, and glorious robes? <hi>Truly, that light will be ſweet, and it will be pleaſant to behold that Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the ſights there would pleaſe thine eyes, ſo the ſounds there will pleaſe thine ears; I have read of a Divine, that when he heard rare muſick on Earth, he was much taken with it, preſently cried out, O the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing muſick which is in Heaven! How will thy ſpirit be taken, when thou ſhalt hear the <hi>new ſong, the ſong of the Lamb,</hi> ſung by the pleaſant voices, and play'd upon the harps
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170410:157"/>of the thouſand thouſands that are before the throne of God, who reſt not day or night, but ſay and ſing, <hi>Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. Thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honour and power: For thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created,</hi> Rev. 4, 8. and <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O how much might I expatiate here, and ſhew thee, that whatever is requiſite to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs would be enjoyed by thee there! If honor could make thee happy, thou ſhouldſt there have <hi>an eternal weight of glory;</hi> ſuch a <hi>weight,</hi> that if thou wert not upheld by the power of God, would preſs thee down. If pleaſures can make thee happy, thou ſhouldſt drink of the rivers of pleaſures which flow from the bleſſed God for ever; ſuch pleaſures as thine eyes never ſaw, thine ears never heard, and thine heart can never conceive. If a gallant glorious ſeat could make thee happy, thou ſhouldſt be happy: Thou ſhouldſt dwell in a City,
<note place="margin">Rev. 21.19, 20.</note> whoſe Builder and Maker is God, its gates are of pearl, and its pavement of pure gold. The houſe which thou ſhouldſt live in, is the <hi>Fathers houſe,</hi> that houſe which the mighty Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth hath erected with his own hands, to be the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will ſhew all his riches, magnificence, grace, goodneſs and glory. If reſt could make thee happy, thou ſhouldſt reſt from all thy labours, enjoy an eternal Sabbath;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170410:158"/>There the ſpiritual oppreſſors ceaſe from troubling, <hi>there the weary are at reſt.</hi> If good company could make thee happy, thou ſhouldſt have the ſociety of all the Saints, ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Prophets, Apoſtles, and all the children of God in the Kingdom of Heaven, thou ſhouldſt enjoy the many millions of holy Angels, the deareſt Jeſus, and the ever bleſſed God. If food can make thee happy, thou ſhouldſt eat of the <hi>hidden manna, of the bread which came down from Heaven, of the tree of life which groweth in Paradice, and drink of the water of life,
<note place="margin">Rev. 22.1, 2.</note> which is clear as Cryſtal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</hi> If life can make thee happy, thou ſhouldſt have that eternal life, which is from God, in God, and with God. In a word, whatever were needful for thee, or could be joyful to thee, or deſired by thee, in order to thy happineſs, thou ſhouldſt have it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thou ſhouldſt know the vertue and preciouſneſs of the blood of Chriſt: the Apoſtle doth not without cauſe, when he compares the blood of Chriſt with ſilver and gold, infinitely prefers it before them, and call it <hi>precious blood,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Indeed, 'tis that which as the diamond to the ring, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth worth and value to what ever 'tis joyned. The two Teſtaments are precious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are both ſprinkled with the blood, and confirmed by the death of the Teſtator,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170410:158"/>
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.16, 17, 18, 19. The Lords Supper is precious, becauſe it ſheweth forth the Lords blood and death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, peace of conſcience, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father, the ſanctification of the Spirit, are all precious, becauſe they are the fruits and effects of this <hi>precious blood,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. and 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. All our comforts run in this channel, the blood of Chriſt is the ſtream which bears them up, and brings them to us; yea, Heaven it ſelf, and the Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have weight and worth from this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſparkling ſtone. Heaven is the <hi>purchaſed poſſeſſion, Epheſ.</hi> 1.14. 'Tis the <hi>blood of Jeſus which giveth boldneſs to enter into that holy place, Hebr.</hi> 10.19. The precious price paid for it will ſpeak it and make it a glorious place.</p>
                  <p>If thou wert once regenerated, Chriſt would be ſo precious to thee at this day, that all things would be <hi>dung and droſs in compariſon of the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus thy Lord; to them that believe Chriſt is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. O the price which true Chriſtians ſet upon Chriſt. The wiſe Merchant ſold all for this Pearl. I have read that the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had a Jewel, which was afterwards ſold for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand duckets. But Chriſt to a Saint is better then ſilver, and more deſirable then choice gold, more precious then rubies, yea, then many millions of worlds.</p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:170410:159"/>
                  <p> When the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ladies were boaſting to <hi>Phocion</hi>'s wife of their Jewels; ſhe told them, My <hi>jewels</hi> are my husband <hi>Phocion.</hi> When <hi>Alexander</hi> was asked, where his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was, he ſhewed them his friends. Such a Jewel, ſuch a Treaſure is Jeſus Chriſt in the eſteem of his Spouſe, his Friends, <hi>Chriſt is all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The pious ſoul is of the ſame minde with <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Almoner,</hi> when at the years end he had given all he had left to the poor, and made even with his Revenues, he looks up to Heaven, and thanked God that he had nothing left but his Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt; to whom he longed to flye with unlimed and untangled wings. The face of none is ſo comely to the Saints eye, the voice of none ſo lovely to his ears, the taſte of nothing ſo pleaſant in his mouth as Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But the Chriſtian hath a choice room in his ſoul, for the blood of his Saviour; He prizeth the ſhameful croſs of Chriſt above the moſt glorious crown of the greateſt earthly Potentate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. Thus Friend, it would be with thee here if thou wert conveted, thou wouldſt determine to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified: O the honey which thou wouldſt ſuck out of the Carkaſs, the death of this <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Judah!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When thou ſhouldeſt conſider, that this blood of Jeſus Chriſt is that alone, which
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170410:159"/>hath ſatisſied Gods juſtice,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25. Rom. 5.9. Col. 1.20. Heb. 9.14. Rev. 1.5, 6.</note> pacified his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, juſtified thy perſon, ſanctified thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, removed the curſe of the Law from thee, and thee from the eternal wrath of God, and unquenchable torments of Hell, would it not be precious blood in thine eſteem? think of it, what a price thou wouldſt ſet upon it; but when thou ſhouldſt in Heaven for ever behold the bleſſed body of Chriſt ſhining with incomprehenſible beauty far above the brighteſt Cherub; and conſider, that every vein of that body bled to bring thee to glory; when thou ſhouldſt ſee thouſands and millions in matchleſs and endleſs burnings, from which thou wert delivered, and behold thy body made far more glorious then the Sun in his high noon attire, and thy ſoul filled brim-full with unſpeakable joy; nay, every part of thy body and ſoul enlarged to the utmoſt, and fully fatisfied with unconceiveable delight, and thou ſhouldſt be confident and aſſured to enjoy this for ever, and know clearly all this to be the travel of Chriſts ſoul, and the fruit of his blood: Friend, friend, what thoughts then wilt thou have of the blood of Chriſt! Surely, 'twill be <hi>precious blood indeed;</hi> thou wouldſt have other manner of thoughts of him that came by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and blood, then thou ever hadſt here below.</p>
                  <p>The work of our redemption will be the matter of the Saints communion, and the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170410:160"/>great ſubject of their eternal admiration. Their delivery from ſin, Satan, wrath and hell, into a ſtate of liberty, love, grace, and ſalvation, by the blood of Jeſus, will fill their eyes, and hearts with wonder, love, and joy for ever.</p>
                  <p>All the voices there ſhall ſing, this ſong and all the vials there ſhall be ſet to this tune. <hi>Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof, for thou haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and nation, and haſt made us unto our God Kings, and Prieſts. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many Angels, round about the throne, and the beaſts, and the elders, and the number of them, was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands, ſaying with a loud voice. Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and glory, and bleſſing.</hi> Rev. 5.9.10, 11, 12, to end.</p>
                  <p>If the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> when ſhe beheld the wiſdom and magnificence of <hi>Solomon</hi> was ſo tranſported that there remained no more ſpirit in her; how will thine heart be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to ſee the love and glory of the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> who wept, and bled, and lived, and died to bring thee to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thou ſhouldſt know what God is; and truly this would be no ſmal part of thy felicity: Knowledge is the excellency of a man and differenceth him from a bruit; divine knowledge is the excellency of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and differenceth him from a Heathen.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170410:160"/>The knowledge of humane things hath been ſo highly eſteemed by ſome of the Heathen, that they have profeſt they would give their whole eſtates to enjoy their books without interruption; what then is the knowledge of divine things worth! <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That a little knowledge of heavenly things, though but conjectural, is better then much certain knowledge of earthly things; what then is the knowledge of the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven worth! The excellency of the object doth much dignifie the act.</p>
                  <p>In this world thou canſt ſee but little of him, thy ſight is ſo weak, but there thou ſhouldſt <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. Now the Chriſtian rather ſeeth and knoweth God as he is not, then as he is; we deſcribe him (for indeed he is infinitely above all definitions) by way of negation to be a Spirit, Infinite, Unchangeable, and the like; which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars tell us what God is not. He is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is, a being without a body; for God is not a Spirit as the ſouls of men and as Angels are, I mean, not of ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: The Spirit of God in that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>God is a Spirit, Joh.</hi> 4. condeſcendeth to our capacities, becauſe we are not able to conceive of the nature of the bleſſed God, as he is in himſelf, therefore the Holy Ghoſt doth ſpeak of God by the moſt excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which our underſtandings reach, as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are; for God is queſtionleſs ſuch a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al being, as is far above the moſt enlarged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170410:161"/>Beſides, we are ſo clog'd and piniond with fleſh, that we know but little, yea very little of our own ſpirits, much leſs what a Spirit God is. But there thou ſhouldſt (if converted) know him fully, thy underſtanding ſhould be enlarged and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe ſcales which now hang about thine intellectual eye ſhould then fall off, and thou that didſt behold him upon earth in the galſs of his Goſpel, ſhouldſt then <hi>ſee him face to face;</hi> as the Sun doth by his beams and brightneſs ſo enlighten the eye and the air, that we ſee thereby, not onely other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but its own moſt glorious body; ſo God would by the beams and beauty of his majeſty ſo irradiate thy minde that thou ſhouldſt ſee both the comelineſs of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the brightneſs of his own being.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhouldſt know the great myſtery of the Trinity, the love of the <hi>Father,</hi> the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Son,</hi> the ſweet fellowſhip of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> That Riddle which now puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thee ſhould there be unfolded; thou ſhouldſt know how the Father begat the Son, how the Spirit proceeded from Father and Son, and the difference between the generation of the Son and proceſſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhouldſt know God in the unity of his nature; now the Saints know him moſt by his Attributes, which indeed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not at all from his Being; they are but
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170410:161"/>different manifeſtations of one individed eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and diſtinguiſhed by us for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding of the Divine Nature, but they are all the ſame in him and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then we ſhall know ſo.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhouldſt know the Hypoſtatical Union,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.20</note> how the Son of God became the Son of Man; that wonder of wonders, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, God with us,</hi> God and Man in one perſon would be clearly ſeen; all thoſe knots would be untied; thou ſhouldſt then plough with Gods heifer, and underſtand all his ridles; thou ſhouldſt know all things in God that were to be known in a full man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in a large meaſure to thine infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and content. Thou ſhouldſt know all this and far more <hi>for thy good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a little knowledge of God here be ſo pleaſant to the ſoul,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.10</note> though it be but a glimpſe of him in the dawning of themorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; what ſatisfaction will the compleat knowledge of him yeild, to ſee that Sun at noon day! If it be life eternal to know God and Jeſus Chriſt imperfectly, what will it be to know them perfectly, and ſo as to enjoy them fully! ſurely ſuch inſtruction will be better then ſilver, and ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then choice gold; this wiſdom is <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then rubies, and all that thou canſt deſire is not to be compared to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How much have many waſted their wealth, dried their brains, macerated their bodies for a little knowledge of Nature,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170410:162"/>which when they had gone to their utmoſt could not ſatisfie them; they might as ſoon have broke their necks as their faſts by ſuch knowledge; but of what ineſtimable value is the knowledge of the God of Nature, is the knowledge of him in Chriſt here, and O of what incomparable worth will it be <hi>to know him, as we are known of him;</hi> to ſee him face to face! this will be without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beatifical viſion.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, thou ſhouldſt know the extent and truth of all the promiſes in the word which concern thy welfare in the other world. How various and how precious are the promiſes which relate to heaven! God promiſeth his children (ſuch as are born of him) large portions when they ſhall come to age, <hi>unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And thou ſhouldſt then find that God will make good his word to a title. He promiſeth <hi>that they ſhall reſt from their labours, and their works ſhall follow them.</hi> That <hi>they ſhall be before the throne, and ſerve him day and night, in his temple, and he that ſitteth on the throne ſhall dwell among them. That they ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sun light on them, nor any heart. For the Lamb which is in the midſt of the throne, ſhall feed them and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes,</hi> Rev. 7.3. <hi>ult.</hi> He promiſeth, that <hi>they ſhall be with Chriſt where he is and behold his glory!</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:170410:162"/>John 17.24. That they ſhall <hi>not be hurt of the ſecond death.</hi> That they ſhall <hi>eat of the tree of life, which groweth in the midſt of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of God.</hi> That they ſhall <hi>be cloathed in white raiment, and not blotted out of the book of life,</hi> but confeſſed before the father and the holy Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7, 11. and 3.5. Chriſt promiſeth, <hi>him that overcommeth will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, which is new Jeruſalem, and I will write upon him my new name.</hi> Rev. 3.12. That they which <hi>overcome, ſhall ſit down with him on his throne, even as he hath overcome and is ſit down with his father on his throne,</hi> Revel. 3.21. <hi>Look Pſalm.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> and 17. <hi>ult. Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.2, ult. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.25, 26.</p>
                  <p>All theſe promiſes and many more, ſhall be fully accompliſhed. There ſhall not one good thing of all that the Lord hath ſpoken be unfulfilled. The expectation of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hath filled ſeveral of Gods Children with extaſies and raviſhments of ſpirit; what joy then will the poſſeſſion of them bring? The very thought of a promiſe hath made them like <hi>Leviathan to laugh at the ſhaking of Spears,</hi> at the threatning of their adverſaries, nay to kiſs ſtakes, and ſmile at fire and fagots. O what then will the performance be! The promiſes are large, but our ſtraitened minds
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170410:163"/>cannot underſtand their breadth, but then happy experience ſhall teach us their full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; they are now like bones, which have the ſweeteſt meat upon them, and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt marrow in them, but we are not able here to pick them clean, nor to ſuck out half the marrow, but then we ſhall taſte and enjoy every thing in them. Now when we read of drinking of the rivers of Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, of dwelling in his houſe, of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and thrones, and ſcepters, and palms, and crowns of glory, and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Chriſt for ever and ever, our hearts are ready to faint, as <hi>Jacob</hi> at the news of his Sons honour in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and as the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> at the news of <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom, believed it not: ſo we; <hi>What God look upon ſuch ſinks of ſin, ſuch clods of clay as we are, and make our vile bodies like unto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body of his Son, and our ſouls like unto his bleſſed Majeſty in holineſs, beauty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light! O what are we, and what our fathers houſes that God ſhould do any thing for us!</hi> As <hi>Perillus</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi> promiſed his daughter fifty talents for her portion, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 'twas too much, ten were ſufficient; And when <hi>David</hi> ſent to take <hi>Abigal</hi> to wife, ſhe wondred at it, ſhe counted it an honour to waſh the feet of his ſervants; 'Twas too much to be his wife. So we cannot but count it a favour to wait upon his ſervants, to be his door keepers and ſtand without; 'tis too much we think to be marryed to Chriſt,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170410:163"/>the eternal Son of God, and to dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever. We can hardly be perſwaded that God will thus dignifie ſuch worthleſs worms; but then ſeeing, and enjoying, will be believing; then we ſhall ſay, <hi>It was a true report, which I heard in the lower world, what God would do for poor creatures in heaven; howbeit I believed not, till I came and mine eyes have ſeen it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the half was not told me; my glory and joy exceedeth the fame which I heard.</hi>

                  <p>Sixthly, Thou ſhouldſt enjoy all the forementioned good things, (and more then I can ſpeak or thou think) without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, interruption, and for ever. The good things of this life are intermitted, partly by contrary and evil things, as our health loſt by ſickneſs, our wealth by want; partly by neceſſary diverſions, the body muſt have ſleep, and then we loſe the comfort of the creatures; but there thy day of comfort ſhould never be overcaſt, for <hi>all tears will be wiped from thine eyes,</hi> and thy fruition of God ſhould be without intermiſſion, thou ſhouldſt ever ſtand in his preſence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his face, thou ſhouldſt <hi>ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. Hadſt thou here a confluence of all comforts, yet becauſe thy life is ſhort, thy joy could not be long; but there thy life will be an everlaſting life, and thy joy therefore everlaſting joy. <hi>I wil ſee you again and your hearts ſhall rejoyce, and your joy ſhall no man take from you, ſaith Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:170410:164"/>
                  <p> Eternity will perfect thy felicity indeed; It is a boundleſs duration, without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and end; Suppoſe that all the vaſt ſpace between heaven and earth were filled with ſand, and once every ten thouſand years, a bird came and carried away a crum in her bill, what a long while would it be before this vaſt heap would be carried quite away! but ſuppoſe after the bird had done that, it was to come every ten thouſand years, and take one drop of water out of the ſea, what a while would it be before it could empty the Ocean! but after all this thou ſhouldſt have as long to continue in thy joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, as at thy firſt entring into heaven.</p>
                  <p>If thou ſhouldſt have but one glimpſe of God, as he was paſſing by thee (as <hi>Moſes</hi> had) it were an happineſs, beyond all that this world can give thee, but thou ſhalt there not have a tranſient view, but a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent viſion of God; thy God would not paſſe by, but ſtand ſtill, that thou ſhouldſt never loſe the ſight of him. When the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject would be ſo lovely, and the act ſo laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would not thy ſpirit be chearful and lively! As the damned ſhall be without all hope ever to be releaſed of their pains; ſo thou ſhouldſt be without all fear ever to be deprived of thy pleaſures. O who would not ſerve ſuch a Maſter, that giveth after poor imperfect works done for him, ſuch infinite eternal rewards! 'Tis bottomleſs love indeed which giveth ſuch a boundles life.</p>

                  <p> Thus Reader, I have given thee a taſte of that, of which thou (if regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſhouldſt have a full draught. Whilſt thou continueſt in this world, thou ſhouldſt be a bleſſed ſoul, bleſſed in thy body, in thy ſoul, in thy calling, eſtate, relations, children and name. All the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God ſhould be profitable to thee; in all thy performances, thou ſhouldſt be acceptable to God, all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God ſhould further thy good; The precious promiſes (one of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the whole world) ſhould all be thy porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When thou entereſt into the other world, thou ſhouldſt be a glorious Saint; Thou ſhouldſt be perfectly holy, and infinitely happy in the knowledg of the bleſſed God, in finding the incomparable fruits of Chriſts blood, and in experiencing the extent, and certainty of Gods promiſes, and thou ſhouldſt enjoy all this not for a year, or an age, or for a million of ages, but for ever, ever, ever. Now what ſaiſt thou to this ſubject of conſideration? haſt thou not unſpeakable cauſe, by an hearty marriage, to cloſe with the Son of God, and accept him for thy Lord and husband, when he offereth ſuch matchleſs priviledges here, and ſuch an heavenly joynture hereafter! Good Lord, is it poſſible for man to be ſuch an enemy to his ſoul, as to neglect ſuch great Salvation! What an hard ſtone is the heart of man, that neither miſery nor mercy
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170410:165"/>can move it. Ah, Friend thou art bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed, if neither the wonderful woe of the unregenerate, nor the unheard of weal of the regenerate can prevail with thee.</p>
                  <p>But before thou readeſt farther, make a pauſe, and conſider what is included in theſe two ſubjects of conſideration. The Heathen tell us, that ſuch as cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by profit or diſprofit, are unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadable. Think of it, here is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage imaginable, if thou wilt turn to Chriſt. Here is the greateſt damage conceivable, if thou continueſt in thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly courſe; ſurely thou art reſolved upon thine eternal ruine, or ſuch reaſons as theſe are, will reforme thee.</p>
                  <p>Ponder this ſeriouſly; if thou refuſeſt the Lord Jeſus as thy Saviour, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, thou art a curſed damned ſinner; if thou accepteſt him thou art a bleſſed, ſaved creature; in the one ſcale there is hell, in the other ſcale there is heaven; upon the turning of either is the turning of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul, its making or marring for ever; if thou wilt not embrace Chriſt upon his own conditions, thy ſoul is loſt; <hi>O the loſs of a ſoul!</hi> thy God, thy Heaven is loſt; O the loſs of a God! no eye ever ſaw greater loſſes; all other loſſes are nothing to theſe; If thou doſt, thy ſoul is ſaved; <hi>how ſweet is that word Saved!</hi> Thy God, thy Heaven is gained; O the gain of a God! how ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury is that ſentence? read it again, If

               <p>Reader, I pray thee ſpeak to God in thine heart, and tell him what is the reaſon thou art ſo willing to go to Hell, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go to Heaven: Sure I am, as thou art a living creature (much more as a rational man) thou haſt a natural inclination and propenſity towards thine own good and felicity, and therefore thou canſt not love Hell directly, as it is torturing and wracking of thy ſoul and body, though thou doſt love it eventually, as 'tis the end of thy fleſhly, ungodly life.

Is it not that thou ſhouldſt ceaſe thy drudgery to Hells-Jaylor,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170410:168"/>live above the periſhing profits, bruitiſh pleaſures, empty honors of the world and fleſh, and that thou ſhouldſt <hi>walk after the Spirit, walk with God, warm thine heart at the flame of his love, bathe thy ſoul in angelical delights, have thy converſation in Heaven here, and thy habitation there hereafter.</hi> Is not this, Man, the ſum and ſubſtance of what the Lord requireth of thee? and art thou not ſhroudly hurt? would not theſe things exceedingly injure thee? Is not God a hard Maſter to deſire ſuch things of thee? Ah, didſt thou but know the worth of them, hadſt thou ever beheld their excellency, or taſted the comforts which is in them, thou wouldſt ſcorn this lower world, with all its pomp, and pride, and pleaſures, for them, and befool thy ſelf to purpoſe for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing or neglecting them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall endeavour, in ſome few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to ſhew thee the worth and excellency of that to which thou art ſo unwilling, and poſſibly thou mayeſt thereby be convinced of thy madneſs and folly, in ſticking at that which would be thine honour and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that an exact face can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be drawn but with much diſadvantage.

As it is the ſame light that ſhineth forth in the morning, which ſhineth in the body of the Sun in its Meridian, ſo its the ſame holineſs that ſhineth in its degrees in the Chriſtian, which ſhineth in perfection in God.

               <p>Now how excellent is the image of God! the picture of a King is eſteemed, and valued at an high rate; but what is the picture of a God! Some ſay that the naked body of

O how beautiful and glorious is his ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Regeneration, the image of God, that both Saints, Angels and Jeſus Chriſt, are taken with it, and wonder at it. He that would not hear, when the diſciples were ſpeaking and wondring at the buildings of the material temple, but contemned it, did both hear, ſee, and admire, at one piece of this ſpiritual temple; when Jeſus heard the Centurions words, <hi>he marvelled and ſaid to them that followed him, I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael, Mat.</hi> 8.10, 15, and 28. Nay Chriſt is ſo taken with it, that his heart is raviſhed and loſt with it, he he is <hi>behearted with it,</hi> Cant. 4.9, 10.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that the bleſſed God after every days work in the creation of the world,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> takes a view of what he had made, he <hi>ſaw it was good;</hi> but when he had made man the ſixth day, <hi>after his own image,</hi> and then took a review of his works, and <hi>ſaw every</hi> thing that he had made, <hi>behold it was very good,</hi> or extream good. So good that it cauſed delight and complacency in God, and called for wonder and contemplation from man; <hi>Behold it was very good;</hi> no doubt but the making of man ſo noble and holy, did above all the viſible creatures, ſo affect the heart of God, that he liked the houſe much the better, becauſe of ſo rare
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170410:169"/>an inhabitant which he had made to dwell in it. Therefore when he had made man, he made no more, man being ſo fair a peice, ſuch curious workmanſhip, that the infinite God reſolved to reſt and delight in him. So when he <hi>createth</hi> a ſoul <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, Eph.</hi> 2.10. he rejoyceth over his new workmanſhip with exceeding joy, and <hi>reſteth in his love, Eph.</hi> 3.17.

And O how, how will it take, not onely perfect ſpirits, but even the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh!

               <p>Reader, have a care that thou never in thy heart plead more for ſin; who would open his mouth for ſuch a monſter, when there is no evil like it! Doth God offer thee any thing to thy hurt, when he would make a ſeparation between thy ſoul and thy ſins? doth he deſire any thing to thy diſadvantage when he deſireth thee to give a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce to ſin, which is the ſourſe of all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, the onely enemy of thy beſt friend the ever-bleſſed God, and to be given up to which is the greateſt plague, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this ſide hell: Tell me, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation

               <p>Thirdly, the price paid for this pearle doth loudly ſpeak its excellency. Reader, little doſt thou think what regeneration coſt. I tell thee (and thou mayſt well wonder at it) The ſon of God came from heaven, ſuffered the boundleſs rage of Divels, and infinite wrath of God, in mans nature, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very errand, to purchaſe regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſanctification, for poor ſinners. Read and admire, <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation; but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. See the worth of this ware, by that which it coſt. <hi>The precious blood of Chriſt;</hi> ſurely it was a jewel of ineſtimable value, which the Son of God thought worth his <hi>precious blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As lightly as thou thinkeſt of the death of ſin, and the life of righteouſneſs, the Lord Jeſus underwent more then any one in hell feels, to buy them of his father for the ſons of men. Ah none knoweth but God and Chriſt, what it coſt to buy off mans debts, and guilt, and to procure a new ſtock of holineſs, for his poor ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krupt creature to ſet up with again. <hi>Who
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170410:173"/>his own ſelf bare our ſins in his body on the tree, that we being dead to ſin, might live unto righteouſneſs.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. Had man kept his original purity, the Lord Jeſus might have ſpared all his pains.
<note place="margin">Tit 2.14. Ioh 10.10.</note> The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> came to reſtore that jewel to man, of which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> robd him.

Did Chriſt come <hi>to deſtroy the works of the Divel</hi> which is ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. and wilt thou build them up? did the Lord Jeſus come to build up the temple of holineſs, and wilt thou pull it down? did Chriſt think it worth the while to be reproached, condemned, crucified, and all to make thee holy, and wilt thou be ſuch an enemy to the croſs of Chriſt, as by continuing in ſin, to deprive him of that which he earnd ſo dearly?
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170410:174"/>Why wilt thou bind thy ſelf to be a ſlave to Satan, when he redeemed thee with ſuch a vaſt ſum?</p>
               <p>Did the mercifull God ſend his ſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to bleſs thee, in turning thee from thine iniquity, and canſt thou look upon that great bleſſing, as thy bondage? <hi>Acts</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> Believe it, God had ſervants enough (even Angels that are ever ready to do his will) to ſend ordinary gifts by; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then twas ſome extrordinary preſent that he thought none worthy to carry, and would truſt none with, but his onely Son. <hi>God ſent him to bleſſe you, in turning every one of you from your iniquities.</hi> I hope reader thou wilt have higher thoughts of holineſs, and worſe thoughts of ſin all thy dayes; ſurely the ſon of God was not ſo prodigal of his moſt precious blood, as to poure it out for any thing that was not ſuperlatively excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Regeneration and the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man will appear to be excellent, in that it is the great end of God in his works The more noble any being is, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ends it propounds to it ſelf in its working; thence it is that a man hath higher ends then a beaſt; the ends of a beaſt are onely to pleaſe ſence, but the ends of a man are to ſatisfie his underſtanding. Hence alſo the ends of a Chriſtian are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the ends of other men; his being is more noble, and ſo are his ends, <hi>To pleaſe,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170410:174"/>glorifie, and enjoy God.</hi> How excellent then is that which the infinitely perfect God makes his end! Surely, the <hi>Moſt High</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not propound any low ends in his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he that is the <hi>onely wiſe God</hi> muſt have eminent deſigns and ends.</p>
               <p>Now unclaſp the ſecret book of Gods decree, and look into it as far as the word will warrant thee, and thou ſhalt finde that in that internal work of Election, God had the renewing of man after his image in his eye, and to be his end; <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love,</hi> Epheſ. 1.4. As an Artificer or Statuary, that hath many pieces of ſtone all alike (hewn out of the ſame Quarry) in his yard, ſets ſome apart from the reſt in his own thoughts, intending to make ſome choice Statue, ſome ſpecial piece of them.</p>
               <p>So when all mankinde was before God, he did in his eternal thoughts ſet ſome apart to be choice pieces, <hi>to be holy and without blame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Go from Gods decree to its execution, from his inward to his outward actions, and thou ſhalt finde thy renewing after his image to be ſtill in his eye. In thy creation he thought of thy regeneration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: Thou art a man, that thou mightſt become a Chriſtian; God made thee a rational creature, that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170410:175"/>thou mightſt be made a new creature; He gave thee the matter, in giving thee a body and a rational ſoul, that thereby thou mightſt be capable of the form, which is the impreſſion of his image on both. There muſt be a tree before it can be hewed and ſquared for ſome curious building. God did not make thee to eat, and drink, and ſleep, and toil in thy calling, but to honor him, and to live to him, which are the actions of the new creature.</p>
               <p>Trace God further, from creation to providence, and therein alſo thou mayſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this to be his end. Why doth he ſend the warm Summer of proſperity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh thee with his clearing beams and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but to cauſe thee to bloſſom, and bud, and ripen in the fruits of holineſs? <hi>There is mercy with thee that thou mayſt be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130.4. Why doth he ſend the nipping winter of adverſity, but to kill the hurtful weeds of thy luſts? This is his end in afflicting, <hi>even the taking avay of ſin,</hi> Iſa. 27.9. He uſeth the flail, that the huskes may flie off; when one key will not open the door of thy heart, he will try another. Why doth he interweave mercy and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that his providences towards the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men are chequer-work, <hi>white and black, black and white; mercy and affliction, affliction and mercy,</hi> but becauſe his infinite wiſdom ſeeth that this mixture will ſuit beſt with his ends, the purifying and renewing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170410:175"/>his creature? If all the year were ſummer, the ſap of the trees would be quite exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if all were winter, it would be quite buried; If thou hadſt nothing in thy body but natural heat, it would burn thee up; if nothing but moiſture, it would drown thee; therefore thy radical moiſture allayeth thy natural heat, and thy natural heat giveth bounds to thy radical moiſture; and each well tempered, make an excellent conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body. If thou hadſt nothing but mercy, thou wouldſt be wanton and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited; if nothing but miſery, thou wouldſt be too much dejected; therefore God ſendeth mercy to make thee cheerful, and miſery to keep thee awful. The good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician tempers his drugs wiſely, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them exactly, and ſo preſcribes and gives them as they may beſt conduce to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of his own end, the ſpiritual health of his Patients.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Regeneration will appear to be excellent, in that it is the ſpecial work of God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Grace is the immediate creatue of God; man can ruine, but not renew himſelf; <hi>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God, John</hi> 1.13. Man may lay ſome claim (though there alſo God is the principal) to the fatherhood of our fleſhly beings; but God onely can lay claim to the fatherhood of our ſpiritual beings. Holineſs is a beam of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170410:176"/>light, darted forth from none but the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs; We are his workmanſhip,</hi> Epheſ. 2.10. <hi>His workmanſhip</hi> both by way of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and excellency.</p>
               <p>How beautiful is that ſtructure which hath ſuch a Builder? what a rare work muſt that be, which hath ſuch a workman! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is a choice plant which is of Gods own planting. O who would not be in love with ſo fair a child for the fathers ſake!</p>
               <p>The creation of our outward beings, as we are men,
<note place="margin">Iob 10.8, 1.10.</note> is the work of God, <hi>Thy hands have made me, and faſhioned me,</hi> Pſal. 119.77. God makes every man as well as the firſt man; Nature and natural cauſes are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the order in which, and the tools with which he is pleaſed to work.</p>

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170410:176"/>to gaze on) <hi>In thy book were all my members written,</hi> Pſal. 139.14, 15.</p>
               <p>A skilful Architect who is to ſet up ſome ſtately building, will draw a model of it in his book, or upon a table, before he will adventure to ſet it up, to be ſure that it ſhall be done exactly. So to ſhew what an exact piece the body of man is, God is ſaid to work it by the book. But the ſoul, which is Gods work too, is a more exquiſite piece; the body is as it were the ſheath, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.15. the ſoul is the glittering ſword; the body is but the cabinet, this is the jewel; 'tis by this that man claims kindred with the Angels in Heaven, and ſurpaſſeth all creatures on Earth.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, if this work of Gods hands, this viſible Creation be ſo excellent, how excellent is the inviſible Creation, the <hi>creating man in Chriſt unto good works!</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is curious work, workmanſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>The Tables of ſtone, hewed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the hand of God, and on which he had with his own fingers written the Law, was ſuch a piece, that mortal eyes could not behold it without aſtoniſhment and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: What a rare Manuſcript was that, where the book, the matter, the writing were all of Gods own making and doing!

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170410:179"/>If God required of thee to live a thouſand years on earth, and to ſpend all that time in hunger, cold, nakedneſs, diſgrace, paines, and impriſonment, or otherwiſe thou ſhouldſt not eſcape unquenchable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and enjoy eternal life, thou wert worſe then mad if thou didſt not accept of, and obey ſuch a command.

               <head>The fourth Subject of conſideration, The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Regeneration.</head>
               <p>FOurthly, Conſider the abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Regeneration; if it were not ſo excellent, yet it is a thing of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore muſt not be neglected. It is not a work of indifferency, which may be done or may not be done, but a worke of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170410:180"/>indiſpenſable neceſſity, which muſt be done or thou art undone for ever. Reader here is an argument, which neither the fleſh nor world nor devil can anſwer, and therefore it muſt not be denied. It is indeed ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a bleſſing, that if thou haſt this thou needſt no more; every thing that is worth ought, is in the womb of it; but it is ſo needful that if thou haſt not this, thou haſt nothing; the whole world cannot make up the want of this.</p>
               <p>There are many things, about which (poſſibly) thou ſpendeſt much time, and takeſt much pains, which are nothing at all neceſſary in compariſon of this.</p>
               <p>Riches are not neceſſary; the want of temporal, may be ſupplied by the fruition of ſpiritual riches: <hi>Thou mayſt be poor in the world, and yet rich in faith, and heir of a Kingdom,</hi> Jam. 2.5. Nay, riches are ſo far from being abſolutely needful, that they may be hurtful to thee. Thou mightſt, as the Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, ſhouldſt thou have good land here, take up ſhort of the <hi>Land of Promiſe.</hi> Chriſt calleth riches <hi>thorns, Matth.</hi> 13.22. and ſurely 'tis hard to touch them and not to prick thy fingers; <hi>How hardly ſhall arich man enter into the Kingdom of Heaven!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pleaſures are not neceſſary; He that hath little but miſery here, may finde mercy hereafter. Though <hi>Job</hi> had his ſores and pains, yet he had a right to the <hi>pleaſures at Gods right hand for evermore:</hi> He that endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170410:180"/>hunger, cold, thirſt, nakedneſs, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting, wearineſs, painfulneſs; that was ſcourged, impriſoned, ſtoned, yet was a <hi>choſen veſſel</hi> unto God, and heir to a crown of righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. to 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6. Beſides, pleaſures may be hurtful to thee; thoſe bees have their ſtings as well as their honey; and many feed ſo plentifully on ſuch luſcious food, that they ſurfeit themſelves. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks of a piece a ground in <hi>Sicily,</hi> which ſendeth forth ſuch a ſtrong ſmell of fragrant flowers, to all the fields thereabout, that dogs cannot hunt there, the ſcent is ſo confounded with the ſmell of thoſe flowers. Earthly pleaſures do not ſeldom hinder our ſcent and ſenſe of ſpiritual delights.</p>
               <p>Honors are not neceſſary: A man may be condemned and lightly eſteemed by men, and yet be commended and highly eſteemed by God. Diſgrace may be the way to glory; <hi>Joſeph</hi> went through a priſon into a palace; and <hi>Jeſus</hi> from a ſhameful croſs to a glorious crown. Honors alſo may be hurtful to thee. Some climb ſo high, that they break their necks: Thoſe that are in high places are apt to have their heads giddy, and thereby are in great danger of falling. <hi>Hamans</hi> height and glory brought him to be high at laſt on the gallows.</p>
               <p>Friends and relations are not neceſſary: He that is friendleſs on Earth, may be a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Heaven; when no man ſtood by <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:170410:181"/>the Lord was with him, and ſtrengthned him; when <hi>David</hi>'s father and mother forſook him, God took the care of him. When thoſe Stars vaniſhed, the Sun aroſe. Theſe alſo may be hurtful to thee, thou mayſt catch their diſeaſes; <hi>Ammon</hi> was the worſe for <hi>Jonadab,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> the more wicked for <hi>Jezebel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Health is not neceſſary: A diſtemper'd body may have an healthy ſoul: <hi>When the outward man decayeth, the inward man may be renewed day by day.</hi> No diſeaſe, ſo it be not ſpiritual, can keep the Phyſician of ſouls from viſiting his Patients; ſanctified ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is far better then unſanctified ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Nay, life it ſelf (which is far more worth then all the foreſaid particulars) is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but in order to this ſpiritual life of Regeneration; If that work be done, a man by loſing his life may be a gainer. Some by yeilding up their Leaſes, which were but for term of years, have got the Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple, the inheritance for ever; by part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their natural lives, they have got poſſeſſion of eternal life. But Friend, Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary. The Emperor told the Mariner (when he would have diſſwaded him from going to Sea,

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:170410:181"/>thou live naturally; thy riches, honors, pleaſures, health, friends, are but toyes and trifles to Regeneration; and truely, life it ſelf is little or nothing worth, but as it makes thee capable of getting and enjoying this. O what a poor empty ſhadow is the life of the greateſt Prince, that is a ſtranger to fellowſhip with God, which Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bringeth the ſoul to?</p>
               <p>The reaſon why theſe fore-mentioned things are not neceſſary, is partly, becauſe the want of all theſe things may be made up in the enjoyment of God; <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, that ye who have followed me in the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
<note place="margin">Matth. 19.28.</note> when the Son of man ſhall ſit upon his throne, ſhall alſo ſit upon twelve thrones judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the twelve tribes of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>There is no man that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſiſters,
<note place="margin">Mark 10.29, 30.</note> or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my ſake and the Goſpels; but he ſhall receive an hundred fold in time, houſes, and brethren, and ſiſters, and mothers, and children, and land with perſecution, and in the world to come life everlaſting.</hi> The regenerate, though never ſo poor, naked, diſgraced, ſickly, yet in the Sun they have all thoſe beams, and much much more. As <hi>Alexander</hi> told <hi>Parmenio</hi> (when in the beginning of a battel, he was earneſt with him to ſend ſome forces to regain their weapons and baggage then newly loſt) <hi>Let usſecure the main bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; for if the field be won, we ſhall recover all our baggage with advantage.</hi> So if the ſoul
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170410:182"/>be ſafe, being by Regeneration grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, if thou wineſt the main battel againſt ſin and Satan, thou wilt recover thoſe with advantage. Thoſe things are not neceſſary, partly, becauſe the want of them will not undo a man for ever; a mans eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate may be ſecured, though thoſe things be removed; but Regeneration is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably neceſſary, becauſe nothing can make up the want of it; not all the golden Mines in <hi>India,</hi> not the ſweeteſt Paradiſe of earthly pleaſures, not the higheſt chair of ſtate, nor friends, nor kindred, nor health, nor ſtrength, nor life, can make up the want of this: If this be wanting, thy God is wanting, thy Chriſt is wanting, thy heaven, thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thy All is wanting. The want of this will undo thee for ever; 'twill make thee miſcarry in the Ocean, this leak will ſink thee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: It is a ſtanding Law of Heaven, <hi>That except a man be converted, he cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 18.3.</p>
               <p>There is in regard of the ordination of God, as great a neceſſity of Regeneration, as of Jeſus Chriſt; for what advantage canſt thou have by all the riches and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Son of God, till by Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thou art married to him, and made one with him? Obſerve, Reader, this fourfold neceſſity of Regeneration.</p>

There is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, either of hearing Gods voice, or feeling Gods hands; either the commandments of God muſt be obeyed by thee, or the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God muſt be inflicted on thee: It is a Goſpel-precept, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23, 24. now Goſpel-precepts muſt be minded by all that would partake of Goſpel-priviledges.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary in regard of the purpoſe of God; <hi>Elect according to the fore knowledge of God through ſanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2. Though God did not chooſe men becauſe they were holy, yet he choſe men to be holy; though he appointed not men to be ſaved, becauſe they were Saints, yet he appointed men to be Saints, and then to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary in regard of the paſſion of Chriſt; he died for ſin, that men might die to ſin; he laid down his life, that men might lay down their luſts; his paſſion is a City of Refuge to the <hi>Penitent,</hi> not a ſactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to the <hi>preſumptuous;</hi> God intended it to help men out of, not to hold them in the mire of ſin; <hi>He is the Author of eternal ſalvation to them that obey him,</hi> Hebr. 5.9. He died becauſe men were ſinners, but he died that men might be Saints; <hi>He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the juſt for the unjuſt, to bring us to God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.

If ever God draw nigh to thee in mercy, thou muſt draw nigh to him in duty. He that ſhall have the reward muſt do the work.

               <p>Thou ſeeſt now I hope clearly the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of Regeneration; what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore canſt thou think to do without it? O ponder this again and again, that there is no eſcape, no evaſion; God will not vary from his Law.</p>
               <p>Thy dying to ſin is neceſſary; ſin muſt die, or thy ſoul cannot live; <hi>If ye live after the the fleſh ye ſhall die; but if ye through the ſpirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live, Rom.</hi> 8.13, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6, 7. Surely thou canſt not think that Heaven will be a ſtye for ſwine, or a kennel for dogs that feed on filth and carrion. Believe it, if any iniquity be let go, thy life muſt go for its life. The Jaylors paid dear for letting <hi>Peter</hi> eſcape, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. <hi>Herod commanded them to be put to death.</hi> Truly ſo dear muſt thou pay for the eſcape of ſin; 'twil bring the ſecond death, even eternal death upon thee: be thy ſin as near and as dear as <hi>Iſaac</hi> it muſt be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; be it never ſo ſmall, it muſt not be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Ceſar</hi> was ſtab'd with bodkins.

               <p>Anſwer me ſeriouſly; thou wilt ſay thou doſt not love ſuch a man, ſo well as to be hangd for him. Doſt thou love ſin ſo well as to be damned for it?

A very Coward will fight, when he muſt either kill or be killed. Willt not thou fight manfully, when ſin will kill thee, if it be not killed by thee? <hi>Ahab</hi> out of fooliſh pitie, gave <hi>Benhadad</hi> his life, when he ought to have ſlain him: but the requital which <hi>Benhadad</hi> made, was to kill <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King. cap. ult. v.</hi> 31, 34. ſuch a requital ſin will make thee if thou fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it.

Let thy conſcience be judge, wouldſt not thou eſteem it injuſtice for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to have the honor and uſe of thy works, or of thine houſe? the Law which is built upon reaſon, gives thee the ſervice of thine own goods, houſes and lands; and why ſhall not God have thy ſervice? with what face canſt thou deny him that ſowed, liberty to reap?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Is there not all the reaſon in the world, that he who lives wholly at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others coſt and charge, that is fed, cloathed, preſerved night and day, protected at home and abroad, ſupplied with all neceſſaries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in all his exigencies, delivered in all his extremities by another, ſhould live wholly to him and do him ſervice?</p>
               <p>Doſt thou not know that thy being, and all thy comforts depend on God every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? that every bit of bread, every breath of air, every hours ſleep, nay every minutes abode on this ſide hell is altogether from his bounty and mercy; that thou canſt not ſpeak a word, nor think a thought, nor lift an hand, nor ſtir a foot, nor open thine eyes to ſee, or thy mouth to eat or drink without him?

Thou doſt a little under God, for the feeding and cloathing of thy children and ſervants, and therefore think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that no duty, no ſervice, is great enough for thee. O how infinitely art thou bound to God for all thy time, health, ſtrength, food, raiment, houſe, friend, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing that thou enjoyeſt! and yet may not God look that thou ſhouldſt make it thy buſineſs, to ſerve, pleaſe and glorifie him! Twas a good vow of holy <hi>Jacob, If the Lord will be with me, and keep me in the way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, ſo that I come again to my fathers houſe in peace, then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> Gen. 28.20, 21.

               <p>Thirdly, Is there not all the reaſon in the world, that wares, or houſes, or any other thing ſhould be for the uſe, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of him that paid a dear price for them! If thou ſhouldſt buy a beaſt at an high rate, thou wouldſt think thou couldſt never have ſervice enough of him.

Thou needſt not grudge the Lord Jeſus thy time, and talents, thy thoughts, and words, and eſtate, and the utmoſt which thou art able to do. Alas he paid dearly for it, <hi>He died that he might be Lord of dead and living, that whether we live we ſhould live unto the Lord, or die, we ſhould die unto him.</hi> Rom. 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We ſay of ſome children, they had need to be dutiful children, they coſt their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dear; many ſharp throws, and great danger of death. O how dutiful hadſt thou need to be, who didſt coſt Chriſt ſuch hard labour, ſuch throws from God, and men, death and divels! thou art never able
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170410:188"/>to conceive what a price thy Redeemer paid, what pain he ſuffered to procure thy ſervice, and wilt thou <hi>deny the Lord that bought thee? Plinie</hi> ſaith that blood will quench fire; ſhould not the blood of Jeſus Chriſt quench the fire of thy luſts? In all countries, the ranſomer of a bondman is to be his Lord; no ſlavery ſo great as thine was, no price ever paid ſo great for liberty; therefore no ſervice ſo great as that which thou oweſt. If thou hadſt done all that he commandeth thee, thou hadſt done but thy duty, and mightſt ſay thou wert an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant; what art thou then that never didſt any thing? O think of it ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; Redemption by the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, is a bloody obligation to ſervice, and if thou continueſt a rebel, twill be a bloody aggravation of thy ſin. What evil hath Chriſt done to thee, that thou walkeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him? Ah friend, to render good for evil, is divine; but to render evil for good, is diveliſh.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Is there not all the reaſon in the world, that he who hath bound himſelf Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to a Maſter, promiſed ſolemnly to be his faithful ſervant, ſealed Indentures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore witneſs, engaged himſelf by vows, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, proteſtations and oaths, ſhould perform his promiſes, and walk in every thing anſwerable to his bonds and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

Haſt not thou liſted thy ſelf under the colours of Chriſt the Captain of thy Salvation, and ſacredly tied thy ſelf to obey his commands, and to fight under his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt the devil, world, and fleſh? and wilt thou run from thy colours, and turn to thine enemies, and conſpire and fight againſt Jeſus Chriſt? It was a cuſtom in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, that ſuch as were baptized, did wear a white Stole (a ceremony ſignifying the purity of life which the baptized were to lead) Now there was one <hi>Elpidophorus,</hi>

Didſt thou not then with <hi>John</hi> ſtand by the croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and behold his bleſſed body bleeding under the knife of his Fathers wrath? how 'twas wounded for thy tranſgreſſions, bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thine iniquities, when thou didſt take a ſacred oath to be the death of thoſe ſins, which were the death of thy Saviour, and to live to him that died for thee; when thou didſt eſpouſe Chriſt and his quarrel to thy ſelf, and engage to live and die with him; and canſt thou like a diſhoneſt wife, run a whoring after thy heart-idols, <hi>and forget the Covenant of thy God?</hi>

Hath not the world conquered thee with arguments which had not the thouſandth part of that weight which the leaſt of theſe hath? and ſhall not thy Maker, Preſerver, Redeemer, prevail with thee by ſetting before thee, the horror of hell, the happineſs of heaven, the beauty of his image, the reaſonableneſs of his ſervice, and the indiſpenſable neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy being his ſervant? Is it poſſible
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170410:190"/>that thy ſoul, ſo cloſely beſieged round about, with fear, and fury, and fire on the one ſide; with favour, and love, and life on the other ſide, ſhould not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render unto Chriſt? What objection canſt thou have which here is not anſwered? What good canſt thou deſire, which here is not offered? and why wilt thou not yield?</p>
               <p>It is thy priviledge that thou art a ſubject capable of Gods image: It was mans primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity,

               <p>Secondly, A pliable ſubmiſſion to the workings and motions of the holy Ghoſt, as at any time he maketh his addreſſes unto thee.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, thou art to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that converſion is not wrought all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and at once, but by decrees; as in the generation of a childe, firſt the brain, heart, and liver is framed, next the bones, ſinews, nerves and arteries, then the fleſh is added; ſo in regeneration, firſt the ſinner

               <p>The match between Chriſt and the ſoul, is not hudled up in haſte, Chriſt firſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a woing.

               <p>Firſt, the firſt ſtep is <hi>Illumination.</hi> The ſpirit of God doth in the firſt place <hi>open the eyes of the blind,

Before the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> ariſeth on the ſoul, there is a day-break of light in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, who was the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Chriſt, and ſent <hi>to prepare his way before him,</hi> did it by <hi>giving knowledge of ſalvation, Luke</hi> 1.76, 77.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that in the covenant of grace, the mind is ſtill ſpoken of to be renewed before the heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.8, 9. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. For tis by the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that grace ſlips down into the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:170410:192"/>
               <p> Satan indeed that cruell Jaylor, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures his captives in the dark dungeon of ignorance. <hi>They are ſtrangers to the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them. Eph.</hi> 4.18. When that uncircumciſed <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> hath taken any <hi>Sampſon</hi> priſoner, the firſt thing he doth, is to put out his eyes; when this is done, he can make ſport enough with him. The evil ſpirit ſtrikes men blind as the <hi>Syrians</hi> were, and then leads them whither he pleaſes; But the good ſpirit opens their eyes, and ſheweth them that they are in their enemies hands, liable every moment to be murdered, and then ſets bread and water before them. Converſion is called a tranſlation out of darkneſs into marvellous light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>The ſinner travelleth in the dark night of his natural eſtate, and miſtaketh his way, (he loſeth himſelf in the miſt of ignorance) but when the morning commeth, the man ſeeth that he hath gone in a wrong path, then he befools, and is diſpleaſed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and turneth about. All the while the creature hath his underſtanding darkened, he walketh in the way of the fleſh and the world, and believeth that to be the right way to happineſs; but when the ſpirit of God enlightneth the mind, the man ſeeth that he was exceedingly miſtaken, begins to wonder at his own folly and wickedneſs, to abhor himſelf, and change his courſe; <hi>I will bring the blind by a way which they
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170410:192"/>knew not;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.16, 17.</note> I will lead them in paths that they have not known; I will make darkneſs light before them</hi> (then what followeth?) <hi>they ſhall be turned back, they ſhall be greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Till the underſtanding of a man be enlightened to ſee the deformity of ſin, and the beauty of holineſs, he will never heartily loath and grief for the former, love and long for the latter. As it is in ſome hot climates, though the Sun ſhine very hot there, yet when there is no entrance for it into mens houſes, twill not ſcorch or heat the inhabitants; ſin is of a ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature; but when the underſtanding, (which is the window into the houſe) is kept ſhut that it can have no entrance into the heart, no wonder if the ſinner feel no pain.</p>
               <p>God hath made the ſame organ for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and weeping. Tis the eye of knowledg which affects the heart.
<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced and mourn,</hi> ſight of ſin doth precede ſorrow for ſin; as ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the infant cometh into the light, it cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, though all the time it was in the dark priſon of the mothers womb it was quiet.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.9, 10.</note> the ſecond ſtep which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit takes, is <hi>conviction,</hi> to convince the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The ſun which did before enlighten his mind, doth now ſlide down with its heating and ſcorching beams into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170410:193"/>That knowledge which the ſinner had of his ſins before, was ſpeculative, but now becomes practical, making ſin like a lump of lead upon tender fleſh, that the conſcience is exceeding preſs'd and oppreſs'd with it.</p>
               <p>Conviction is the application of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin, and danger of ſinners to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in particular, which before he knew in the general; as in the twilight before the Sun ariſeth, a man may ſee abroad, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee in his own houſe; but when the Sun ariſeth a man can ſee both abroad, and at home within his own doors: So before the Spirit approacheth the ſoul in a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, the ſinner could ſee abroad, he knew that the ſoul that ſinneth muſt die, that they which do ſuch and ſuch things, cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; he knew theſe things in the general, but he could not ſee in his own houſe, in his own heart, that he himſelf was a great ſinner, a dead, a damned creature; for though he would in his prayers acknowledge that he had broken the Law, and was thereby liable to the wrath of the Lord, yet he did it but cuſtomarily and formally, not beleeving what he ſpake; for ſhould another man come to him, and tell him, <hi>O Friend, you daily provoke God, and are every hour in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hell,</hi> he would flye in his face, and tell others, that he was a very uncharitable man, and all becauſe the ſinner could not
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170410:193"/>ſee in his own houſe; but when the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſeth, the ſinner can ſee within as well as without doors; he ſeeth the hainous nature of his own ſins, and the grievous danger of his own ſoul.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God convinceth the ſinner of four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the Spirit convinceth him of his great and innumerable corruptions.</hi> The man before knew in the general, that <hi>all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs himſelf a ſinner formally, and ſlightly; but now he feels himſelf a ſinner, and finds experimentally that he is a polluted poiſoned creature. The Spirit of God holdeth the glaſs of the law, before the eyes of his ſoul, and makes him whether he will or no, ſee what dirt and deformity is in the face of his heart and life. Without the law there is no tranſgreſſion, and without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the law there will be no conviction. As one of the perſecutors in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> ſearching an houſe for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, askd an old woman in the houſe, <hi>Where is the Heretick?</hi> ſhe points to a Cheſt of linnen, upon which ſtood a looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, and bid him look there and he ſhould ſee him; he lookt there, and ſtill asked <hi>Where is he?</hi> She meant that he himſelf was the Heretick, and in the glaſs he might ſee himſelf. So before the Holy Ghoſt came to convince this ſinner, if the miniſter at any time had preached againſt pride, unbelief,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170410:194"/>carnal-mindedneſs, hypocriſie, and the like his voice was, Where are theſe men? Surely the Miniſter meets with ſuch and ſuch in his Sermon; but now the ſpirit in his conſcience ſpeaketh to him, what <hi>Nathan</hi> did to <hi>David, Thou art the man.</hi> Thou art the proud, carnal, hypocritical, curſed ſinner, which the word of God meaneth, &amp; the man cannot deny it. The Holy Ghoſt puls off his rags, and plaiſters, and makes him ſee all his nakedneſs and ſores; it lanceth his wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, and now he beholdeth the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous matter and corruption which is in them, that he little thought of before.</p>
               <p>Formerly he eſteemd himſelf to be ſound, comparing himſelf with them that were worſe, or not minding the inward meaning and extent of the law of God; but now by the law the ſpirit brings him to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. It ſheweth him the depravation of his nature, how full it is of pollution, even as full as ever toad was of poiſon; how empty it is of all good, nay what an enemy it is to God and godlineſs; it ſheweth him the abominations of his heart, how <hi>the imaginat ons and thoughts of his heart have been evil, onely evil, and that continually;</hi> the provocations of his life, how full that hath been of luſts and ſins, even as the firmament of ſtars; it ſheweth him the evil of his thoughts, of his words, of his deeds, his omiſſions in his cloſet, in his family; his commiſſions abroad, at home; it ſheweth
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170410:194"/>him his idolatry, in ſetting up <hi>Self</hi> as his God, in bowing down to it, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping it, his adultery in going a whoring after the creatures, loving, fearing, and truſting them more then the creatour <hi>who is bleſſed for ever.</hi> It ſheweth him how he hath diſhonoured the name of God, grieved the ſpirit of God, undervalued the Son of God, violated every command of God; how he hath ſinned againſt the firſt command in not worſhipping and glorifying God as the only true God, and as his God, and in giving that honour to others, which is due to him alone; againſt the ſecond, in not worſhiping God, according to the word, but according to the traditions of others, or his own inventions; againſt the third, in not reverencing the name, word and works of God; againſt the fourth in not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Sabbath to Gods ſervice, but prophaning it, either by idleneſs or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labours, or omiſſion of duties, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; againſt the fifth, in not carrying himſelf according to his duty, towards them that are above him, equal to him, or below him. Againſt the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, in wronging his neighbours, either in regard of life, chaſtity, goods, name, relations, either in thoughts, words or actions.</p>
               <p>It ſheweth him the darkneſs of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the ſtubbornneſs of his will, the diſorderedneſs of his affections, the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170410:195"/>hardneſs of his hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, the ſearedneſs of his conſcience, the miſ-improvement of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, how his eyes have beheld vanity, his ears been open to iniquity, all his ſenſes been through-fares to ſin, all the members of his body inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs, how from the crown of the head to the ſoals of his feet there is no ſound part in him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wounds, bruiſes, and putrified ſores.</p>
               <p>It is not one or two ſins that trouble this ſinner, but innumerable evils compaſs him about; whole ſwarms of theſe Bees flie in his face and ſting his conſcience; it may be one ſin did firſt ſet upon him, ſome ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light which God had given him; and now that creditor hath caſt him into priſon, all the reſt come and clap their actions upon him to keep him there; his ſins in his dealings with men, in his duties to God, his ſins againſt ſeaſonable corrections, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt merciful diſpenſations, his ſins againſt the motions of Gods Spirit, againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his own ſpirit, againſt light, love, purpoſes, promiſes, they all compaſs the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner round that he cannot eſcape; now he ſees the ugly loathſomneſs of all his luſts, how they are againſt an infinite God, againſt a righteous Law, againſt a precious ſoul, how by reaſon of them he is wholly unlike God, and become the very picture of the Devil; and truly now he is far from having thoſe flattering thoughts of himſelf, and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of his ſins which formerly he
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170410:195"/>had; for ſins part, <hi>tis abounding, polluting, poiſonous, ſinful ſin;</hi> He ſeeth the wrinckles of this <hi>Jezabels</hi> face under her paint, and O how ugly is ſhe in his eyes; and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he is more out of love, then ever he was in love with himſelf. Some ſay after they have had the Small-pox that they come to ſee themſelves in a glaſs, they look ſo ugly by reaſon of their ſpots that they cannot endure to ſee themſelves: Truly this poor ſinner beholding himſelf in the glaſs of the Law, and viewing thoſe helliſh ſpots of ſin all over his ſoul and body, he abhorreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt thing the Spirit convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the ſoul of, and that is ſin; <hi>When he is come he ſhall convince the world of ſin,</hi> Joh. 16.8. God never cured a ſpiritual Leper but he cauſed him to fall down firſt and cry out, <hi>unclean, unclean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit convinceth him of his miſerable and dreadful condition. Now the commandments of God come to the ſoul, ſin reviveth, and the ſinner dieth. He thought before that he was whole, a ſound man, to have little need of a Phyſician, but now he both ſeeth his ſores, and feeleth his wounds.</p>
               <p>Miniſters before had frequently told him of his dangerous damnable eſtate, but he had a ſhield to keep off all their darts; <hi>He was not ſo bad as they took him to be; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what they muſt ſay for their money; and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170410:196"/>beſides though he were as bad as ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe cenſorious Preachers would make him to be, yet God was a merciful God, and Jeſus Chriſt died for ſinners, and he hoped to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as well as the beſt of them;</hi> but now God comes to him as he did to <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, <hi>Adam, where art thou? Haſt thou eaten of the tree of which I ſaid unto thee thou ſhalt not eat? Sinner where art thou? Doſt thou know what thou art doing, and whether thou art going? how dareſt thou prophane my day, blaſpheme my name, ſcoff at my people, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect my worſhip, caſt my Laws behinde thy back, and hate to be reformed? Dareſt thou provoke the Lord to anger? art thou ſtronger then he? how will thine heart endure, or thine hands be ſtrong in the day that I ſhall deal with thee? Doſt not know, poor dry ſtubble, that 'tis a fearful thing to fall into my hands? for I am a conſuming fire.</hi> Now the ſinner heareth the voice of God, and is afraid: Alas, alas, thinks he, I am a dead, a damned man; the Almighty God is angry; the weight of my ſins at preſent is heavy, but the ſufferings which I am every moment li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to are infinite and eternal. O that I ſhould ever be born to do as I have done! Now the lightnings of divine fury flaſh in his eyes, and the canons of the Laws curſes thunder in his ears; he ſeeth a ſharp ſword of pure wrath hanging by a ſlender thread of life over his head; he feeleth the ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his ſins, thoſe fiery ſerpents at his
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170410:196"/>heart. There is no reſt in his fleſh becauſe of Gods anger, nor quietneſs in his bones becauſe of his ſins; the arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty are within him, and the poiſon thereof drinks up his ſpirit; the waves and billows of God go over his ſoul, and he ſinketh in deep waters; God writeth bitter things againſt him, and makes him to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ſins of his youth: Now the man is calmed, he will hear what God ſpeaketh: before, though God himſelf had told him out of his word what a wicked wretched man he was, he would not minde it, but ſtorm and rage at it; he was like a wilde Aſs ſnuffing up the wind, and as an untam'd heifer impatient of the yoke; he would kick and fling like a mad man, <hi>What he give credit to the doctrine, and ſubmit to the ſevere diſcipline of a few whimſical Puritans, that muſt be wiſer then all their neighbors!</hi> no not he, though they ſhewed him the very hand of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to thoſe warrants which they deſired him to obey. But now he is of another mind, for the Law <hi>hath ſhut him up under ſin and guilt,</hi> Gal. 3.22. The Law hath pent him in, and <hi>ſhut him up</hi> that he cannot poſſibly get out: As Lions, Bears and wilde beaſts are tamed by being ſhut up, and kept in, ſo the Law cauſeth wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. ſhuts the ſinner up under it, and keeps him in, that his former ſtarting holes cannot help him, and thereby tames him.</p>
               <p>While he was unconvinced of his ſins and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170410:197"/>miſery, his conſcience was ſeared, not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at all the threatnings which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him; but now his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſore, touch it which way you will you put him to pain; tell him under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, of his drunkenneſs, or ſwearing, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, or eagerneſs after this world, &amp; heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs about the things of the other world, his neglecting God in ſecret, of not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and praying with his family, tell him how cold and cuſtomary he was in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, ſaying to others that they took more pains for heaven then they needed to do, of his juſtifying himſelf in his tranſgreſſions, and taking part with Satan againſt his own ſoul; he crieth <hi>Guilty, Guilty,</hi> when ſuch Bills of indictment are read againſt him; but every word in them is a deep wound to him; the wolf in the breſt, and worms in the belly do not cauſe half that pain which his wickedneſs doth by gnawing in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Tell him of the Goſpel, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely merciful God is, and how inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably meritorious Chriſt is, and how freely the glad tidings of the Goſpel are offered to all; O this toucheth him to the quick, the ſword of the Goſpel cuts him more to the heart then the ſword of the Law. O, ſaith he, <hi>This, this is my death, were it not for this I ſhould have ſome hopes of life; but alas, I have abuſed mercy, which is the only friend I have left; I have deſpiſed Chriſt, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great ſalvation which was tendred to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170410:197"/>me in the Goſpel; Vile creature that I am, Mercy, Love and Grace came many a time woing me! how did Jeſus Chriſt himſelf with pardon and life come beſeeching me, begging of me to open my heart and let him in, and yet curſed wretch that I was, I denied him! when the world could lie warm in my boſom all night, and ſin get a good room in my ſoul, yet my Saviour muſt ſtand without, and not be thought worthy to be let in! I have moſt unworthily ſpurned againſt his bowels of compaſſion, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſweeteſt and moſt affectionate perſwaſions, moſt deſperately refuſed the only means of my recovery; and therefore I, what ſhall I do? whether ſhall I go? If one man ſin againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the judge ſhall judge him;
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.25.</note> but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall entreat for him? If I had ſinned only againſt my Creator, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer might have ſatisfied for me, but I, wretched I, have ſinned againſt my Redeemer, and therefore who ſhall intreat for me?</hi> O the frights and fears, the horrors and terrors which this poor creature ſuffereth under the ſight and ſence of his ſins and guilt; but the fore-thoughts of an everlaſting miſcarriage in the other world ſinks him quite down, that he is able to hold up no longer. Thus the Spirit firſt plougheth up the fallow-ground of the heart, before he caſteth into it the ſeed of grace; he firſt captivates the ſinner, and brings him into a ſpiritual dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, under chains of guilt and horror, that the very irons enter into his ſoul before
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170410:198"/>
                  <hi>he proclaimeth liberty to the captive,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 61.1, 2.</note> and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound:</hi> Some indeed are brought lower then others with legal terror; but ſurely, not a few have ſailed to Heaven by the very gates of Hell. God is reſolved that men ſhall feel ſin either here or hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Spirit convinceth him of the impotency and weakneſs of all the things in the world to help him; that in the whole garden of Nature there is never an herb which can make a ſalve to heal his wounded conſcience. Now the ſinner is ſcorched with the heat of Gods wrath, he is like a man in a burning feaver, full of pain, and he tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth and toſſeth from one ſide of the bed to the other, trying and hoping for eaſe; he goeth to this carnal comfort, or that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane help to have his pain abated, and his ſores cured, but none of them will do; as faſt as he claps on thoſe carnal plaiſters, the Spirit cauſeth his conſcience to rub them off.</p>
               <p>It may be firſt the man uſeth forreign drugs; he being troubled in conſcience, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with <hi>Cain</hi> to the building of Cities, to earthly imployments, that the noiſe of the hammers might drown the voice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that his minde and body being oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied about other things, conſcience might have no time nor leaſure to proceed in preaching its cutting Lectures; or elſe like <hi>Saul,</hi> he runneth to his muſick, to carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170410:198"/>to merry meetings, jovial compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his preferment or pleaſures in the world, or ſome carnal diverſion, if it be poſſible to turn the water of his thoughts into another channel, and ſo to keep that mill from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which makes ſuch a clacking dreadful noiſe in his ears, and threatneth to grind him to powder. Thus ſinfully fooliſh is man; as ſoon as ever a fire is kindled in his ſoul, which would aſpire to heaven, he runneth with his buckets to earthly ſprings, and fetcheth water thence to quench it; the throws of the new birth do no ſooner come upon him, but he, like ſome ſimple women, takes cooling things, which cauſe his labour to go back again. But the Holy Ghoſt (for I am now ſpeaking of one in whom the Spirit goeth through with the work) makes all theſe things empty to him; the vertue of thoſe poor cordials is ſoon ſpent, and now the man is as ſick as before. Conſcience for all theſe interruptions, ſtill followeth him with its Hue and Cry by a warrant from Heaven, for the breach of Gods Statutes, that the ſinner can houſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in any of theſe worldly comforts, but conſcience is at his heels, raiſing the Town upon him, and giveth him no reſt; the man finds this phyſick but like hot water to one in a cold fit of an ague, which warms a little at preſent, but makes his hot fit the more violent.</p>
               <p>When the ſinner findes that his exotical
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170410:199"/>drugs will not cure him, he will try in the next place Kitchin phyſick, he will be his own both Doctor and Apothecary; he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth that his praying and grieving, and trouble of minde, and reſolution to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will ſatisfie Gods juſtice, and pacifie his own conſcience, and heal it throughly. O how the man endeavors to lick himſelf whole! man is a proud creature, unwilling to beg or borrow of his neighbors, very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous rather to make a poor ſhift with what he hath of his own. The Mariners will row hard in a ſtorm to get to ſhore by their own power, before they will awake Jeſus with <hi>Save us Maſter, or we periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Spirit convinceth him of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of all his prayers, and tears, and duties to appeaſe God, or ſatisfie his Law; the Spirit ſheweth him the narrowneſs and ſhortneſs of all his rags, how they cannot poſſibly cover his nakedneſs; conſcience telleth him that by his very duties, he is ſo far from paying his old ſcore, that he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth further in debt: <hi>Alas,</hi> ſaith Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>thy very duties may damn thee; He who is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity, ſeeth a thouſand holes in thy beſt coat; the holy God ſeeth ſins enough in them to ſend thee into Hell for them. Canſt thou, poor begger, with thy counterfeit farthings think to pay an infinite ſum? Can thy poor finite performances ſatisfie infinite Juſtice for the violation of his righteous precepts? And for thy reſolutions of better
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170410:199"/>obedience, canſt thou think that future obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience can ſatisfie for former diſobedience? No, though thou couldſt offer thouſands of rams, and ten thouſands of rivers of oil; nay, though the firſt-born of thy body; all theſe could no: be a propitiation for one of the leaſt ſins of thy ſoul; no, no, the redemption of a ſoul is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for all theſe it muſt ceaſe for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus God ferrits the ſinner out of all his Borows, and cauſeth the poor Prodigal, while he is wandring from his Father, to finde a famine in all the creatures. As a General that beſiegeth a City, doth not onely play in upon it with his Cannons and Granadoes, but alſo ſecure the ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, ſtop all proviſion that no relief can come to it, then they will yeild upon his terms: So when the Spirit beſiegeth the ſoul, it often plyeth it hard with the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the Law, and alwayes ſtoppeth relief from coming in, either from the world, or a mans own righteouſneſs, and then, and not till then will the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yeild upon the terms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Spirit convinceth him of the willingneſs, ſutableneſs, and al-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Jeſus Chriſt to help and heal him.</p>
               <p>The ſinner now in his burning fit is very thirſty; like <hi>Hagar,</hi> he ſits weeping, for his bottels are empty, and his creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are found by experience to be broken
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170410:200"/>ciſterns which can hold no water, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what to do; how can I ſee the death of my ſoul? thinks he. When the ſinner is brought to this ſtrait, the ſpirit of God openeth his eyes, to ſee a well of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>even Jeſus who delivereth from the wrath to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpirit diſcovereth to the ſinner that though his wound be dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the God whom he hath provoked, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, either to have his law ſatiſfied, or his eternal wrath endured; yet that it is not deſperate; for there is <hi>Balm</hi> in <hi>Gilead,</hi> and a Phyſitian in <hi>Iſrael</hi> that can heal his ſoul.</p>
               <p>It convinceth him, that Chriſt is a ſutable help, bread to the hungry, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the thirſty, reſt to the weary and heavy-laden; that he hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſalve made of his own blood, which is a proper and pecular remedy for his ſores.</p>
               <p>It convinceth him that Chriſt is an alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient help, that he can ſupply all the ſouls wants, be they never ſo many, and bear all the ſouls iniquities be they never ſo weighty, that <hi>he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt thoſe that come unto God by him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> It preſenteth to the ſoul his fitneſs and fulneſs in regard of his natures, and offices, and the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his being unfaithful to this great work of ſaving poor ſinners, for which he came into the world. It ſheweth the ſinner
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170410:200"/>the infiniteneſs of Chriſts merits, and his omnipotency to help becauſe he is God: the examples of other wounded diſeaſed perſons, who ſurrendred themſelves, to the care of this Phyſitian and were cured; <hi>He ſhall convince the world of righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I go to the father, and ye ſee me no more.</hi> John 16.9, 10. That is, the world ſhall be convinced that there is righteouſneſs enough in me to ſatisfy both the law and law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in that I ſhall appeare in my fathers preſence, and that with acceptance: he would not ſend an Angel as his officer, to roll away the ſtone, and releaſe the ſurety out of priſon, the grave, and bring him before the Judge with ſo much credit and countenance, if the law were not ſatisfied, and the debt fully diſcharged. Heaven could never have held me; ye would have ſeen me upon earth again, if I had not done that work perfectly, which the Father gave me to do. <hi>He ſhall convince the world of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, becauſe I go to the father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It convinceth him that Jeſus Chriſt is exceeding willing to ſave poor ſinners; that he is joyful that any will accept him for their Saviour; that he came from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to earth, was born meanly, lived mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably and died ſhamefully, meerly upon this errand, that he might ſeek and ſave them that are loſt, that he inviteth him; to come to him and promiſeth that he ſhall be welcom; that he calleth them that go from
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170410:201"/>him, but caſteth away none that come to him.</p>
               <p>Thus when the prodigal is in a far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and cannot fill his belly ſo much as with husks, that he is ready to periſh for hunger, he is ſhewd and convinced that <hi>there is bread enough in his Fathers houſe.</hi> When the ſinner is like the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in the wilderneſs, beholding the curſe of the law like the <hi>Egyptian</hi> behind him, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him hard, the red ſea of divine wrath before him, into which he is haſtening, his crimſon and bloody ſins like mountains on each ſide of him, incompaſſing him round, that he knoweth not what to do, then the ſpirit biddeth him look up to Jeſus, and he ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God.</p>
               <p>The third ſtep which the ſpirit takes, is <hi>anhelation,</hi> to cauſe the ſoul of the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſinner, to breath and pant after Jeſus Chriſt; breath is the firſt effect of life. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction hath emptied his ſtomach of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture confidence and ſelf righteouſneſs, made him poor in ſpirit, and O how hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry he is after the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the bread which came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi> As the thirſty ground cleaves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens for drops, as the heart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth his ſoul after Jeſus Chriſt, God bleſſed for ever, (thinks he) <hi>O when ſhall I come and appear before him!</hi> His voice is (like <hi>Rachel) Give me
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170410:201"/>children or I die;</hi> Give me <hi>the holy child Jeſus or I die;</hi> or like <hi>Abraham, Lord, what wilt thou give me if I go childleſs?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 12.21</note> O what wilt thou give me if I go Chriſtieſs! or like the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Philip, Sir, we would fain ſee Jeſus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28.5.</note> If the Angel ſhould meet him, he might beſpeake the ſoul as he did the woman, <hi>I know what thou ſeekeſt, thou ſeekeſt Jeſus which was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> O the ardent deſires, the vehement longings, the unutterable groans, which this poor creature hath after his Saviour! as <hi>David,</hi> he cryeth out, <hi>Who will give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem!</hi> Where is that bleſſed guide, that can leade me, and help me to drink of the water of life!</p>
               <p>Methinks I ſee how Jeſus Chriſt preſents himſelf to the eye of the dejected ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in all his glory and gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in his ſutableneſs unto the ſinners indigencies, and ſufficiency for all his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, with the freeneſs of his mercy, the fullneſs of his merits, and the ſweetneſs of his love; how he appeares before the ſoul with all his retinue and train of graces, comforts, his blood, his ſpirit, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, freedom from ſin, wrath, hell; on the one hand of him there ſtand his gracious promiſes of pardon, peace, adoption, ſanctification, heart-chearing love, and everlaſting life; On the other hand of him, there ſtands his precious precepts of ſelf denyal, crucifying the fleſh,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170410:202"/>walking after the Spirit, deſpiſing the ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pleaſures, honours, and profits of this world, and delighting in God, walking with him, having the converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and rejoycing in hope of glory. In the middle, there ſtands the faireſt of ten thouſands, adorned as a bridegroom with his richeſt attire, gliſtering with the jewels of thoſe graces, with which his humanity is adorned, in a greater degree then the heavens could, though every ſtar in it were a glorious ſun; but O how the diamond of his deity ſparkleth in the ſouls account, that millions of worlds would be but a muck-heap to it. Ah how lovely is he in the ſinners eye!

O that I, O that I might be ſo bleſſed as to be called to the marriage ſupper of the Lamb!</hi> Who can expreſſe the vehement, violent longings of this man after Chriſt, as the loadſtone of his affections, as the onely center of his ſoul, the proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for all his maladies; had he the beauty of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> the renown of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wealth, the worth of the whole world, like the wiſe Merchant, he would ſell all
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170410:202"/>to buy this pearle of price, and think it the beſt bargain that ever he made; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo dear to him but he will give it; nothing is ſo difficult but he will do or ſuffer for Chriſt; he is of the ſame mind with the Martyr, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi> It is reported of a woman that was in theſe throws, that ſhe ſhould ſay, I have brought nine children into the world with as much pain as moſt women, yet I would bear them all over again, and bear them all my days for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is mention made of a bird in <hi>Egypt,</hi> near <hi>Nilus,</hi> called the bird of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which they ſay, if it be once enſnared is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and mournful till ſhe be delivered: ſo is this convinced ſinner, now he feels himſelf entangled in the bonds of iniquity and ſnares of the Devil, he is unquiet till he be delivered. Talk to this man of his reſpect and friends, and riches in the world, they are as the white of an egg, or a dry chip without any ſavour, reliſh, or nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him; but tell him of Jeſus Chriſt, an able Surety to diſcharge all his debts, O that is the ſavory meat which his ſoul lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; As a man that is ſick and extreamly pained, when you talk to him of his calling or eſtate, he heareth not, he regardeth not; but tell him of one that can cure him of his diſeaſe, and eaſe him of his paine, then he will hearken to you; thus tis with this ſinner; all his delight is in hearing of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170410:203"/>Chriſt, all his longing is to hear from Chriſt. The poor priſoner that is condemned to be hanged, and hath ſent a meſſenger to ſue for a pardon, never longed ſo much for his return with joyful news, as this poor creature for an intereſt in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour.</p>
               <p>Thus the Spirit having convinced the ſoul of its beggery and nakedneſs, bondage and miſery, cauſeth it to breathe and long after the riches, liberty and righteouſneſs which is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſtep is <hi>lamentation;</hi> the ſoul that breatheth after a Saviour, is truly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his ſins; his groans after liberty are accompanied with grief for his ſlavery: Now the clouds gather and thicken over the ſoul, and fall down in tears; his ſorrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conviction of his miſery was legal, but now tis for his abuſe of mercy, and ſo Evangelical. His heart before was as a cloud broken by a thunderbolt, being torn in pieces violently, and making a mighty noiſe; but now like the cloud melted by the ſhining of the Sun upon it, it diſſolves down ſweetly into a fruitful ſhowre.

               <p>The pump of the ſinners heart was dry, till the water of goſpel grace, apprehended and hoped for, was poured in, and then it ſendeth forth abundantly.

               <p>His contrition runneth all along parallel with his confeſſion; his heart worketh more then his lips and hands; his affections are much more ſelf-abaſing and humbling then his expreſſions; he ſeeth him whom he hath pierced, and mourneth; <hi>Calvary</hi> is a <hi>Bochim,</hi> a place of weeping to him; his eyes are ſo full, that though Chriſt be nigh him, yet like <hi>Mary,</hi> he cannot ſee him for tears; never fountain ſent forth water more freely then this ſinner doth godly ſorrow; when he conſidereth what he hath done, how he hath ſinned, what a God he hath greived, ſorrow and grief overwhelm his ſpirit.</p>

               <p> The fifth ſtep is <hi>implantation into Chriſt;</hi> the Spirit now leadeth the childe by the band unto Chriſt, nay, grafteth him into Chriſt. The ſoul being convinced of the neceſſity it ſtands in of Chriſt, of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſery which it muſt undergo without Chriſt, of the al-ſufficiency that is in Chriſt, how willing, how able he is to binde up the broken heart, and to ſave the ſinful ſoul, doth by the help of the Holy Ghoſt venture its ſelf, and its everlaſting eſtate up-Jeſus Chriſt, reſolving to ſtand or fall, live or die at his feet.</p>
               <p>The ſinner is now between hope and fear, not knowing how he ſhall fare. As the four Lepers that were ſhut out of the City in the famine of <hi>Samaria,</hi> conſidered with themſelves, <hi>If we enter into the City, the famine is in the City, and we die there;
<note place="margin">Kings 7.3.</note> and if we ſit ſtill here, we die alſo: Now therefore, come and let us fall into the Hoſt of the Syrians, if they ſave us alive, we ſhall live; and if they kill us, we ſhall but die;</hi> and accordingly they went to the Syrians camp, found food there, and lived. So the ſinner pondereth in his heart, If I go to the world, and the <hi>lying vanities</hi> thereof, I periſh, vanity of vanities is written upon all its enjoyments, the famine is there, there is nothing that is bread, its whole ſhop cannot afford a plaiſter which can heal my wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; if I ſit ſtill in this condition under the weight of mine iniquities, I periſh; they
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:170410:205"/>will unqueſtionable ſink me into Hell; now therefore I will fall into the hands of the Lord Jeſus; If he ſave my ſoul, I ſhall live; if he deny to receive ſuch an unworthy wretch as I am, I ſhall but die, I can but periſh, I will therefore venture; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the ſoul goeth to him, and findeth life in him; I have ſometime thought, that when the ſinner is come thus far, he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf much like <hi>Eſther:</hi> When the King had made an irrevocable decree for the deſtruction of her ſelf and people, what doth ſhe do? ſhe faſteth, and prayeth, and ſendeth word to <hi>Mordecai, I will go in unto the King, which is not according to the Law, and if I periſh, I periſh,</hi> Eſth. 4. <hi>ult.</hi> Thus the poor broken-hearted ſinner, perceiving that the King of Kings hath made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, <hi>That the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> and he is a grievous ſinner, he faſteth, he mourneth, he prayeth, and at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth; Well, I will go in unto the King, though it be not according to the Law (which ſhutteth me up under guilt and wrath) If I periſh, I periſh; poſſibly he may hold out the golden Scepter of Grace, and I may live in his ſight; thus the poor creature goeth, maketh ſupplication believingly, and prevaileth.</p>
               <p>The Devil now layeth all the blocks he can poſſibly in the ſouls way, to hinder its journey to Chriſt. As when the woman talked to her husband of going to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

Thus, <hi>To what purpoſe ſhouldſt thou go to Chriſt?</hi> (ſaith the Devil to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinner) <hi>Canſt thou think that ſo holy and righteous a God will have the leaſt reſpect for ſuch a wicked notorious hell-hound as thou art? I tell thee, he hath ſent thouſands, that never ſinned as thou haſt done, into Hell, and canſt thou have any thoughts of Heaven? Thou haſt done my work all thy dayes, and now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for a reward from God; No, no, Ile pay thee thy wages in blackneſs of darkneſs for ever; if thou hadſt intended for life, thou ſhouldſt have minded it ſooner; thou haſt dayes without number broken the Law, and many a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Goſpel, and now 'tis too late; God called, and thou wouldſt not hear; now thou mayſt call long enough, for he will not hear thee; he tells thee as much with his own mouth,</hi> Prov. 1.25, to 32. <hi>Therefore thou mayſt ſpare thy pains, and prayers, for all will be to no purpoſe; Surely, thou haſt a impudent face, and a brazen forehead, to expect ſuch choice bleſſings as pardon and life from that Chriſt whom thou haſt perſecuted in his people, rejected in his Laws, preferring the world and thy fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and daring him to his very face.</hi> Thus he that was the ſinners tempter to thoſe ſins, turns his tormentor for them,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170410:206"/>and he that when the ſoul was poſting to Hell, bid it not doubt of Heaven, doth, now the creature is creeping towards eternal life, perſwade him, that 'tis impoſſible to eſcape eternal death: But notwithſtanding theſe diſcouragements, the ſinner will go to the great Prophet of the Church for the life of his dead ſoul; He thinks <hi>'Tis true, I am a grievous ſinner, but I know that he is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Saviour; I ſee nothing but miſery and hell in me, but I ſee mercy and heaven in him; for my warrant,

<note place="margin">Ioh 6.33.</note> him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out. I will therefore go what ever come of it, and lay my ſelf at his feet; if he condemn me, and ſpurn me into Hell, Ile juſtifie him; peradventure he may lend me his hand, and raiſe me up with hope of Heaven; others have gone to him, and he hath bid them welcom. O the rings and robes, the kiſſes and embraces, which many returning Prodigals have had of him! who knoweth but he may be gracious to me! if he had not been willing that poor ſinners ſhould live, he would not have dyed; if he had been unwilling that I ſhould come why doth he call me? Well, what ever come of it, I will go; it may be I may be hid in the day of the Lords wrath.</hi> Thus Faith at firſt ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but on one weak foot.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, that when the ſinner is in this condition, the very command of God
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170410:206"/>(enjoyning him to believe in the name of his Son) is a ſpecial inſtrument in the hand of the Spirit to draw him unto Chriſt; like <hi>Abraham,</hi> he being called of God, obeyed, not knowing whither he went; he being called of God to caſt himſelf on Jeſus Chriſt, obeyeth, not knowing how he ſhall ſpeed.</p>
               <p>The Diſciples, when they hear Chriſt ſpeaking to them in the morning, <hi>Caſt on the other ſide of the ſhip, and ye ſhall finde,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, <hi>We have fiſhed all night and caught nothing, nevertheleſs at thy command we will let down the net.</hi> So the penitent man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tried this and that means, and found no water, no meat, no ſolid food for his hungry and thirſty ſoul, heareth at laſt Chriſt calling to him, <hi>Ho every one that thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, come to the waters, buy wine and milk without money, and without price;</hi> caſt thy ſins, thy ſoul on me, and thou ſhalt finde reſt; Lord, thinks he, I have tried creatures, and they cannot help me; I have tried duties, and they cannot eaſe me; I have taken much pains and caught nothing; and ſhould I come to thee, wouldſt thou open thine eye upon ſuch a wretch! my unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs makes me miſtruſt the ſucceſs, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs at thy command I will do it, and now he cometh in his ſinking eſtate to take hold on <hi>the arm of the Lord</hi> which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſtretcheth out to him, and thereby he is ſaved.</p>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:170410:207"/>
               <p> The laſt ſtep is a <hi>reſolution</hi> of the ſinner to give up himſelf to all the Laws of Chriſt, or an hearty acceptation of the Redeemer as Saviour and Soveraign. The heart of the man is ſo melted by Evangelical ſorrow for ſin, and the heat of Gods love to his ſoul, that he is like ſoft wax for any impreſſion; God may command him what he pleaſeth, he <hi>cleaveth to the Lord with full purpoſe of heart:</hi> Before, he was like the Prodigal, he muſt go as far as he could from his Fathers houſe; the orders there were too pure, the Laws there too ſtrict, the diſcipline there too ſevere; he travelleth therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a far Country, but now the man is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, he will ſubmit to do the duty of a Son, ſo he may but have the childrens bread and diet; nay, now he is come to himſelf, it is his meat and drink to do the will of God: he ſeeth ſuch equity in Gods will, ſuch beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his worſhip, ſuch excellency and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his wayes, that he would not part Jeſus Chriſt and his holy precepts (which he now ſavoureth) for all earthly pleaſures; he is tied ſo firmly to his Maſter with the bond of unfeigned love, that Satan himſelf will but work at the labour in vain, when he goeth about to ſeparate him and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>He writes Holineſs to the Lord upon his body, ſoul, eſtate, family, relations, and all that he hath, thankfully acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods propriety in all, and his own felicity
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:170410:207"/>to conſiſt in improving all for God. He conſidereth how infinite his obligations to God are, what an hell of endleſs horror he is redeemed from, what an heaven of love and happineſs he is called to, and wiſheth that he had or could do ſomething worthy of ſuch a God. And becauſe he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more or better, he gives himſelf to God: as <hi>Aeſchines</hi> when he ſaw his fellow-ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers give their Maſter <hi>Socrates</hi> large preſents, being poor, and having nothing to give, went and gave himſelf to his Maſter, acknowledging that he was his devoted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
               <p>The ſinner before was unbroken, and ſo as unfit for ſubjection, as the unbroken colt for the ſaddle, but now the heart being humbled, the eare is heedy to whatever God ſpeaketh; <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9.6.</p>
               <p>It is with an humbled,
<note place="margin">M. <hi>Fenner</hi> of the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of the Law.</note> and with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled ſinner, as with two men that are going to market, whereof the one hath need, he and his family are in extreme want, ready to periſh for bread; now this man will go, what ever weather come; if it raine never ſo faſt he will go; when he comes there, whatever the price be, he will buy; though he pawn his cloaths, he will have bread; why? he is like to famiſh for want of it, bread he comes for, and bread he muſt have. The other hath no great need, therefore if he like the weather he will
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:170410:208"/>go; if not, he will ſtay at home; if he goeth, when he comes to the Market, he will buy, or forbear, as the price of things pleaſeth him; he is indifferent, whether he lay out his money or no; if commodities are held at an high rate, he will go as he came, and buy nothing, and all becauſe he hath no need; he can do well enough without them; thus an humbled ſinner ſeeth, nay feeleth his extreme need of Chriſt, that he muſt periſh everlaſtingly, without an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, and therefore what ever it coſt him, he will have Chriſt; he is reſolved to deny himſelf, to crucifie the fleſh, to hate father, mother, houſe, name, land, all for Chriſt, let God hold the price of his Son never ſo dear, he will ſell all but he will buy this pearl; and what is the reaſon? truly becauſe this man hath need; he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the abſolute neceſſity which he ſtandeth in of Chriſt, that none but Chriſt can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from the weight of his ſins, the Almighty Gods fury, and the vengeance of eternal fire, therefore a Saviour he comes for, and a Saviour he will have, what ever commands or prohibitions are joyned with him; but an unhumbled finner feeth not his extream need of Chriſt, and therefore though when he heareth of the infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in Chriſt, and the unſpeakable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:170410:208"/>the price is too dear, he will not come up to it, and why? truly becauſe he ſeeth not his need of Chriſt; he thinks he can do well enough without Chriſt. If God would let him ſerve Chriſt, and the world, and fleſh with him, he would not care much, if he did buy; but if he cannot have Chriſt at his own price, farwel Chriſt, and pardon, and mercy, and God, and eternall life,
<note place="margin">Mat 9.12.</note> farwel for ever for him, and all becauſe the man is an <hi>whole</hi> man, unbroken, unhumbled. But you have read in the former ſteps, that the ſinner before he comes thus far, is throughly melted, and therefore he is for any mould which God thinks good.</p>
               <p>Yet I believe that a man or woman, whom the Spirit of God hath brought over to Jeſus Chriſt, doth by the new nature beſtowed on them, or the law of God written within them, reſolve upon all known duties, and againſt all known iniquities, more out of love to God and holineſs, then out of any ſlaviſh fear of wrath and hell. The man ſeeth by the law the contrariety of ſin to the image of God, and conſequently to his own real and ſpiritual good, whereby there ariſeth within him not onely an eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs from, but an emnity againſt ſin; though it were the object of his affections before, yet tis the object of his paſſions now. So for duties, the ſoul is brought through working of the Spirit, to approve and delight in the <hi>good and perfect, and acceptable will of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170410:209"/>God,</hi> Communion with God, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, are the utmoſt of his deſires, and indeavours. O how willingly doth this Chriſtian take upon him the yoak of Chriſt, not complaining of its uneaſineſs, but of his own unholineſs.</p>
               <p>The man formerly was as a Virgin; before marriage ſhe ſtandeth upon her terms, ſhe will indent with her Sweet heart, what ſhall be ſetled upon her, and how he ſhall deal with her, or elſe ſhe will not have him; but now Chriſt by his ſpirit hath prevailed with the ſoul, and 'tis heartily willing to take him for better for worſe, to reſign up all to Chriſt, to part with all for Chriſt, to take all from Chriſt, to be diſpoſed in all by Chriſt, in a word it promiſeth with the whole heart, to be a loving, faithful and obedient wife, and now the match is made, nay the Saviour and the ſoul are actually married together. And O what an happy joyful day is this? If <hi>Aaron</hi> when he met <hi>Moſes,</hi> was glad at his heart, how glad is this poor ſoul, now he meets with the <hi>Meſſias!</hi> The Father accepts him for his child, the Son accepts him for his ſpouſe, the Spirit hath given earneſt already to have the Chriſtians heart for his everlaſting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; the Devils in hell are vexing, the Angels in heaven are ſinging, the Saints on earth are ſhouting, for it is meet that they ſhould be merry; for this ſon was dead and is alive, was loſt and is found,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:170410:209"/>was a curſed ſinner, and is become a bleſſed Saint.</p>
               <p>So I have diſpatched the firſt branch of this ſecond help to regeneration; namely, an obſervation of thoſe ſeveral ſteps whereby the wandring ſheep is brought home. I come now to the ſecond branch of this help, which is <hi>a pliable ſubmiſſion to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and motions of the Spirit, when the Spirit at any time maketh his addreſſes to thy ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, I muſt earneſtly beſeech thee, if thou haſt the leaſt ſpark of love to thy ſoul and endleſs good in the other world, that thou be more tender of the motions of the Spirit, then of the apple of thine eye. When the Holy Ghoſt cometh to thy ſoul by its motions to good, thy kinde entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, may (be as much as thine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs is worth and) probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the Spirit to ſtay with thee, perfect the work, and abide in thee for ever; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if thou ſhouldſt grieve or quench the Spirit, and affront this Ambaſſador which is ſent to treat with thee about terms of peace between God and thy ſoul, he may be called home, and thou never hear of him more.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 2.2.
<note place="margin">Incubabat aquis. Iun. Gen.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</hi> Several read the words, The Spirit of God was ſitting, or hatching upon the waters: It is a Metaphor taken from birds or hens,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:170410:210"/>they ſit and move upon their eggs to hatch them, and bring them forth, and when they are hatched, they ſtill ſit and move upon them, to cheriſh and bring them to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So the Spirit of God ſat, or moved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that face of the deep, that by his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or incubation, he might hatch and bring forth out of that vaſt <hi>Chaos</hi> the ſeveral kindes of creatures. Thus the Spirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth upon thy heart, he ſitteth upon, he broodeth on thee, that he may hatch and bring thee forth a new creature: Therefore conſider what thou doſt, and how thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt thy ſelf towards him; fowls when they have been much diſturbed, have left their eggs and never hatched them, they have come to nothing; ſhouldſt thou reſiſt the Spirit in his operations, or quench him in his motions when he is brooding on thy ſoul, he may take its eternal flight from thee.</p>
               <p>When the Spirit cometh to thy ſoul by its motions, diſſwading thee from ſin, or ſtirring thee up to holineſs, Jeſus Chriſt then knocks at the door of thy heart; every motion is a knock from the hand of Chriſt; if thou hearkeneſt and openeſt, he will come in and ſup with thee; but if notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his knocking, thou wilt not hear, though he cometh upon an errand ſo infinitely for thine advantage, he will depart away in a diſtaſt, (as neighbors when they are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilly uſed) and thou mayſt never hear of him more.</p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:170410:210"/>
               <p> Thou art apt to complain that thou wanteſt help to turn from ſin, and to turn unto God: I tell thee when the Spirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and worketh within thee to minde thy ſoul, and thine eternal eſtate, he offereth thee his help and aſſiſtance; and if thou hearkeneſt to, and obeyeſt his motions, thou ſhalt have his help. <hi>As he was teaching, the power of God was preſent to heal them,</hi> Luke 5.17. Whilſt the Son of man was teaching, at that ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thou art diſeaſed, the tender Phyſitian cometh to thee, without ſending for, and giveth thee his bleſſed counſel without asking, and tis this, that thou muſt forbear thy lewd ſinful ways, or elſe thou wilt loſe thy ſoul, thy Saviour, thy God, thine happineſs for ever; Now wilt thou (by continuing in ſuch courſes and rejecting his firſt counſel) ſay <hi>Farewel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoul, Farwel deareſt Saviour, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel bleſſed God, Farwel glorious Angels,

               <p>When a noble perſon ſhould come to thine houſe, one by whom thou expecteſt to be promoted highly, and inriched greatly, or one whoſe heir thou lookeſt to be, how welcome wouldſt thou make ſuch a man, eſpecially the firſt time that he commeth to viſit thee? and upon thoſe very accounts, I mean for thy advantage, he muſt have the beſt room, the beſt fare, the moſt pleaſing language, the moſt reſpectful car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; all things muſt be done as much as poſſibly can be, according to his mind, and nothing muſt be done which is known to be offenſive to him; and all, leſt he ſhould be provoked to forſake thee, to caſt thee off, and to do nothing at all for thee. Reader, is there not far more reaſon, that when the infinite Spirit of the bleſſed God cometh to thine heart, who onely is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote thee, to become the child of God, an heir of heaven, and to inrich thee with the image of God, in Regeneration; that when he cometh firſt to thee, and for theſe very ends, thou ſhouldſt give him all the reſpects imaginable, that thou ſhouldſt follow his counſel, forbeare what thou knoweſt grieves him, do what thou knoweſt

But thou knoweſt that the condition of one in travel is very tickliſh; a little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage may then undo both mother and child; therefore it behoveth thee now to be extraordinary careful what thou doſt and how thou carrieſt thy ſelf; it is as much as thy life is worth: For thy direction I ſhall tell thee what thou ſhouldſt not do, and what thou ſhouldſt do.</p>
               <p>Be ſure that thou do not run to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for comfort: Fooliſh people when ſometimes an able Chirurgion hath laid ſome ſharp medicine to their feſtered wounds, which puts them to much pain, though, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by ſuch means the rottenneſs of them be eaten up, and the corruption in them forced out, they can never be cured, yet they are ordinarily ſo impatient, that they will not endure it; but as this good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that neighbour if they do not

Thus, thus do too many with the Phyſitian of their ſouls, and thereby do often undo themſelves. The Spirit of God applyeth the terrors and conſternations the Law, to make way, and prepare them for the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and conſolations of the Goſpel; the good Samaritan poureth wine into the wound to ſearch it, before he poureth oil to heal it; now fooliſh men are impatient, not able to bear ſuch ſad melancholy thoughts, (as they call them) and therefore they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten break away from the Spirit of God before they are throughly humbled, and run to their earthly enjoyments, whereby they get ſome preſent eaſe, but here or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after far greater pain.</p>

               <p>Reader, didſt thou never know of any that were in a journey, and coming to ſome deep dirty pochy lane, they thought to avoid it, and broke over the hedge into the field? but when they had rod round and round, they could finde no way out, but were forced to go out where they got in; and then notwithſtanding their unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to go through that mirie lane, or elſe not to go that journey. Truly ſo it is in thy journey to Heaven; thou art now come to this deep lane of humiliation, through which all muſt go that will reach that City <hi>whoſe builder and maker is God;</hi> do not think to avoid it, no not the leaſt part of it; for this is the narrow way and ſtrait gate that leadeth to life: Suppoſe thou ſhouldſt run to the world, or any thing here below, now thou beginneſt to be ſenſible of thy ſickneſs and pain, and ſo in an hopeful way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: Firſt, 'tis impoſſible that any of thoſe things can cure thee; <hi>Miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters are they all, and Phyſitians of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</hi> Can a ſilver Slipper cure the gout? or a golden Crown the head-ach? or the greateſt Empire in the world the pain of thy teeth? much leſs can theſe things cure the diſeaſes of thy ſoul: All the wrapping
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170410:217"/>of thy foot, that hath a thorn in it, though with never ſuch fine ſcarlet cloth, will be altogether ineffectual to eaſe thee of thy pain; for the thorn muſt be pulled out; ſo muſt ſin be pluck'd out, its guilt removed before thou canſt poſſibly be eaſed: But my great reaſon is, (which I deſire thee to conſider ſeriouſly) ſhouldſt thou throw off this medicine of thy ſpiritual Phyſitian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſomewhat ſharp, and run to the Empericks and Mountebanks of the world, thou wilt provoke thy tender able Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian to leave thee (for what man will bear ſuch affronts) and where art thou then? what will become of thee for ever? Thoſe that work in Coal-mines finde by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the earth ſendeth up damps which quench and put out their candles; and what then becomes of the men that are there? they are often ſlain. Shouldſt thou like <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> run from the preſence of the Lord, to more pleaſing employments then the work of a thorow humiliation, either he will bring thee back again to the ſame buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by ſtorms and tempeſts, or elſe ſuch damps will ariſe from thine earthly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions as will quench Gods Spirit, and eternally ruine thy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The evil ſpirit I know will be buſie to perſwade thee to ſmother and put out the ſparkes (which the good Spirit hath kindled within thee) by heaps of worldly rubbiſh and dirt: but take heed what thou doſt,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:170410:217"/>for thy ſoul is at ſtake; if thoſe ſparks ſhould die, thou art like to live in hell fire for ever. Obſerve how it fared with unhappy <hi>Felix.</hi> He was a Priſoner to his Priſoner, and in a ready way to have been one of Chriſts freemen, but now hells jaylor was like to loſe one of his captives, (for I queſtion not but Satan for fear of loſing him, trembled more then he) what therefore through the Divels advice muſt <hi>Felix</hi> do? He muſt needs cure himſelf of his convulſion by an abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diverſion. When the Spirit ſtruck in with the word and cauſed him to tremble, he ſendeth <hi>Paul</hi> away till another ſeaſon, and we never read when that time came. Had <hi>Felix</hi> ſtruck in with the Spirit, when the iron of his heart was hot, he might have been happy indeed, but he quencheth thoſe motions, which were ſo likely to recover his ſoul, and thereby (in all probability) miſſeth ſalvation.</p>

I am confident that carnal diverſions, that, To put back thy pangs by earthly affaires, much more by wine and ſtrong drink, is infiniely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the babe of grace, and many to one but it may cauſe thine eternal miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>Friend, that which in this caſe I would
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:170410:218"/>adviſe thee to do, is to betake thy ſelf to thy cloſet, or chamber, and there to fall down before the moſt high God, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, indict, and condemne thy ſelf for thy ſins, poure out thy ſoul before the Lord in acknowledging the pollution of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the tranſgreſſions of thy life, with all their bloody aggravations, confeſſing the righteouſneſs of the law, and thy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſs thereby to the infinite and eternal wrath of the Lord. O now is the onely time to repent, with that repeniance which is never to be repented of; if ever thou wouldſt draw water, and pour it out before the Lord, it muſt be now the ſpirit hath thawed the tap; neglect this ſeaſon, and it may freeze again ſpeedily. When <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> came from God to <hi>David</hi> after his fall, (when he had lain in his impenitency many months) and told him of his ſins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him that he was worthy to die, what doth <hi>David</hi> do? doth he run to his crown or honour, or power in the world? No. Doth he haſtily ſnatch at the promiſes? No, but he goeth to God (as appeares by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and body of the 51. <hi>Pſalm</hi>) bewaileth his original and actual ſins, condemneth himſelf, juſtifieth God, offereth up the ſacrifice of a broken heart, beggeth hard for pardon and holineſs. O do thou follow this bleſſed pattern; if thy body were ſick of a violent feaver, and nature were ſo far thy friend, as when thou waſt in thy bed,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:170410:218"/>to put thee into a fine ſweat, and thereby give thee hope of evacuating the ill humours (which cauſe thy diſeaſe) through the pores, what wouldſt thou do in this caſe? wouldſt thou riſe preſently, and run into the cold aire, or wouldſt thou not rather abide ſtill in thy bed, and if need were, call for more cloaths, to increaſe thy ſweat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thy body might be perfectly cured? Thus it is in the ſtate of thy ſoul; thou art ſick unto death; the Spirit of God is ſo much thy friend, as to help thee to ſweat out thy diſtemper by humiliation, and godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; twere a madneſs in thee now to run to the open air of the world, or to do any thing which might hinder this ſweating; thy onely way is to encourage and increaſe it, by betaking thy ſelf to thy chamber, and there to look into thy heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how full it is of unholineſs, to look back upon thy life, and conſider how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it hath been to the Divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:170410:219"/>will keep them ever burning. Philoſophers tell us, that elementary fire wants no fuell, though culinary doth.

               <p>Reader, if thou art humbled as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken, thou lookeſt on thy ſelf as a vile creature, even as a dog; I would have thee now very careful, that thou wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently (for the bountiful houſe-keeper of the world, is preparing ſome good food for thee) and do not eatch too haſtily at the childrens bread, the promiſes, leſt it be taken from thee, and thou meet with a blow.

Do thou wait Gods leiſure, bemoaning thy ſins, abhorring thy ſelf, praying fervently for thy ſoul, and be confident that Jeſus Chriſt, who is already upon his way, will ariſe upon thee ſpeedily, with healing under his wings.</p>
               <p>It may be that this tender able Phyſitian, cometh nearer to thee, he doth not onely ſhew thee the nature and danger of thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and make thee (who wert before ſenſleſs) apprebenſive of it, by feeling thy ſickneſs, but doth alſo diſcover to thee an excellent and coſtly remedy, which hath

He acquainteth thee with the alſufficiency of Jeſus Chriſt to ſave ſinners; that he is a Saviour of Gods own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one in whom God hath given under his hand, that he is well pleaſed; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer that hath in him infinite meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe he is the onely begotten of the father; if he ſheweth thee long bils of others debts which have been canceld by the blood of Chriſt, and aſſureth thee that he is not onely able, but truly willing to ſave thee, that he was wounded for thy tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and by his ſtripes thou mayſt be healed: The Holy Ghoſt poſſibly ſetteth the King of Saints before thee, in all his robes, and riches, and righteouſneſs, (as it were) thus beſpeaking thee; <hi>Come poor ſinner, that lyeſt weltring in thy blood, heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to me, and thou ſhalt ſee what I can and will do for thee; though by thy wilful breach of the Law, thou art liable to ſuch endleſs bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fury, as thou couldſt neither abide nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void; yet I will be a Skreen between thee and the unquenchable fire. Ile ſatisfy the law, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:170410:220"/>pacify my father, Ile not onely deliver thee from ſin and Satan, wrath, and death, and damnation, but adopt thee for a Son, intereſt thee in that ineſtimable treaſure, the covenant of grace, and make thee an heir of the eternal weight of glory; and all this thou ſhalt have freely and ſurely, if thou wilt but accept me thankefully and heartily for thy Saviour and Lord.</hi> At the hearing of which loving lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage thou probably art amazed, and ready to ſay as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> (when <hi>David</hi> told him that he ſhould eat bread at his table con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually) <hi>What is thy ſervant that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead dog as I am!</hi> Thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mireſt the riches of Chriſts merits, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mercy, and the happineſs of his members; thy ſoul begins to be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love with him, and affectionately longing after him; O thinkeſt thou, Had I but Chriſt for my portion, though I were never ſo poor in temporals, I could be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily contented. Now Chriſtian, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is come nigh unto thee, thou art now upon thy quickening, be but careful there, and thou art made for ever. I know that thy broken heart is willing to go to Jeſus Chriſt, but have a care that thou carry nothing to him, that thou keep nothing from him; thy miſcariage in either of theſe, may quite break off the bargain between Chriſt and thy ſoul, as near as tis driven.</p>
               <p>I ſay, carry nothing to Chriſt; Thy
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:170410:220"/>next ſtep muſt be quite out of thine own doors; the Devil knoweth how to ſlay thee as well by thy righteouſneſs, thy mournful contrition for ſin, as by thine unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thy wilful commiſſion of ſin, which made <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay, <hi>That repentance damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more then ſin;</hi> nay, thy truſting upon thy prayers, or tears, or any good in thee, doth alter the nature of them, and turn them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin; in this many ſtick; they are hardly brought off from their own bottoms. When mens houſes are on fire, their covetouſneſs to ſave their goods hath often loſt them their lives; when mens ſouls are in a flame, their pride to carry out with them their good prayers, and good deſires, and good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hath loſt them eternal life; they will pay ſome of their braſs-farthings towards the reckoning, and God therefore makes them pay the whole ſhot.</p>
               <p>O how unwilling is the creature to be beholden to Chriſt, his Surety, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his debts! though he be a meer bankrupt, yet he hopes he may compound with his Creditor, and pay ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſatisfaction; and this ariſeth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his ignorance of that righteouſneſs which alone can ſatisfie the Law, or pacifie the Lord; <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10.3.

Did they but know, that that righteouſneſs which pleaſeth God for their juſtification, muſt anſwer the Law in its full latitude, and all its dimenſions, they would not offer their droſſy duties, no nor their golden graces for currant coin, which being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that <hi>ballance of the Sanctuary</hi> muſt needs be found infinitely too light. Partly from his pride; <hi>For they being ignorant of the righteouſneſs of God, and going about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. 10.3.

               <p>Reader, now thou art in a ſtorm, if thou loveſt thy ſoul, do not run to ſhelter thy ſelf under the rotten houſe of thy own righteouſneſs; for be confident 'twill fall

The Law of man denieth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from the Pariſh to them that have any thing of their own to ſubſiſt by; and the Goſpel of God denieth allowance from the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, to all them that have of their own for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Do not think to piece thy rags up with Chriſts robes, for it will not be allowed; go to Jeſus Chriſt ſtark naked for his glorious rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, altogether poor for his precious riches; there is a neceſſity of being found wholly in him, or wholly out of him, there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.

<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.16 1 Pet. 2.6.</note> a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation; He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on him ſhall not be confounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I would have thee careful that thou carry nothing to Chriſt; ſo alſo that thou keep nothing from Chriſt. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſerve God, there was not a hoof to be left behinde. There muſt be no reſervation, no exception, but an abſolute hearty dedication of thy ſelf, and all thou haſt unto Jeſus Chriſt; if thou halfeſt or
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:170410:222"/>halteſt now, thou art an undone man: As <hi>Samuel</hi> asked <hi>Jeſſe, Are all thy ſons here?</hi> and denied to ſit down and feaſt with him till all were preſent; ſo truly Chriſt will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to cloſe with thy ſoul, to ſit down and ſup with thee, unleſs all thou haſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and unfeignedly devoted to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>But in a ſpecial manner, be careful that no ſin be kept from the ſtroke of Chriſt: As when <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the whole City was in an uproar; ſo now the Lord Jeſus is coming into thine heart, there will be old ſtir among thy corruptions; how ſtrongly will they plead, if not for their formes open allowance, yet at leaſt for a ſecret inward connivance; little doſt thou think how buſie Satan will be for a writ of partition, that ſince he cannot prevail for all thy heart, that yet he may be admitted an equal ſharer with Chriſt; he will tell thee, (but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he was a Liar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) that thou mayſt keep thy ſins and thy Saviour too; that Chriſt is not ſo ſtrict, but that for a fair agreement he will allow ſomewhat to the fleſh. But I beſeech thee, not to think of any League with the leaſt of thy luſts: Surely, if thou ſeeſt any loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſt, thou canſt not but judge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin loathſom; beſides, he were a poor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, if he could not make thee amends for thy parting with the moſt pleaſureable or profitable ſin. Who would think, that
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:170410:222"/>thou like <hi>David</hi> ſhouldſt plead for <hi>Abſolom,</hi> for ſin when it ſeeks to bereave thee of thy crown and life? Truly ſhouldſt thou grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Satan ſo far as to hide any wedg of gold, or Babyloniſh garment, any one luſt I muſt tell thee, that one, be it never ſo ſmall, would like a little boy put in at a caſement, open the door of thine heart for many thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh luſts, and great ones too, to enter in. If thou allow the old Serpent but room for his head, he will quickly wind in his whole body. Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> being in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtorm upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> was heard to ſay, Muſt I who have eſcaped the rage of the Ocean, be drowned in a ditch! Surely thou mayſt ſo far comply with Chriſt, as to take thy leave of ſcandalous enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; yet if thou reſerveſt favourable thoughts towards any ſecret iniquity, thou deſtroyeſt thy ſelf. And it will be all one, whether thou art ſlain by a ſmall Piſtol, or by a great Cannon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corruption may cloſe with religion a great way</hi> (ſaith a Divine) <hi>and hear gladly and do many things;
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> on Hoſ. 14. ſer. 7.</note> but there is a particular point of ſtrictneſs, in every unregenerate mans caſe, which when it is ſet on cloſe to him, cauſeth him to be offended and ſtumble, as in the young man, and</hi> Herod. —<hi>This is the difference between hypocritical and ſincere converſion. That goeth far, and parts with much, and proceeds to</hi> almoſt, <hi>but when it comes to the turning point, and ultimate act of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:170410:223"/>regenerate, he then plays the part of an unwiſe ſon, and ſtays in the place of the breaking forth of children, as a fooliſh Merchant, that in a rich bargain of a thouſand pound, breaks off upon a difference of twenty ſhillings; but the other is content to part with all, and to ſuffer the loſs of all, to carry on the treaty to a full and final concluſion, to have all the armour of the ſtrong man taken from him, that Chriſt may divide the ſpoiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, thou knoweſt upon what terms thou mayſt contract a bargain with Chriſt, for the ſaving of thy ſoul; that thou muſt not think to have him for thy Saviour, unleſs thou wilt accept him for thy Lord alſo. As <hi>Boaz</hi> told his kinſman, that if he would enjoy the inheritance of <hi>Ebimelech,</hi> he muſt have <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſs</hi> to be his wife; ſo ſay I to thee, if thou wilt have the inheritance, the portion of Jeſus Chriſt, thou muſt have his perſon for thy husband, and reſign thy ſelf to be ruled by his precepts. The Jews that ſtayed themſelves upon the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and yet continued rebellious, were more bold then welcom. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.1, 2. Now thou art come thus far, do not go back, and to ſave a pin, loſe a Kingdom. Thou mayſt be confident that nothing can ever be enjoined thee by Chriſt, but what is reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and honourable, tending to thy real and eternal good, as well as his own glory; therefore now the Maſter is come and calleth for thee, do thou anſwer, <hi>Lo I come to do
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:170410:223"/>thy will O my God, thy law is in the midſt of my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friend, if the Spirit of God hath been ſo favourable to thee, as to kindle ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as I have mentioned) within thee, for the Lords ſake, cheriſh them, obey them leſt thy quenching the Spirit bring thee to that fire which can never be quencht. <hi>To day if thou wilt hear his voice, harden not thine heart, leſt he ſwear in his wrath, that thou ſhalt never enter into his reſt.</hi>

               <p>Reader, Obſerve five particulars in this third help to Regeneration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and attend on the means of grace.</hi> The ordinances of God, are the Marts and Faires, whereat Chriſtians muſt trade for grace. At them thou mayſt buy ſpiritual commodities, <hi>without money, and without price.</hi>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:170410:224"/>The ever bleſſed God hath upon a twofold account, enjoyned the uſe of his ordinances, partly out of ſoveraignty over us, that we might thereby acknowledg that homage and fealty which we owe to his Majeſty; Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of mercy to us, that we might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in receive of his Spirit and grace. By our attendance on ordinances, as by a pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn, (for all that we can do is very little) we acknowledg of whom we hold, and to whom we are bound, and alſo they are the door at which God giveth his gracious doles; The manna of the ſpirit doth uſually fall down in the dews of ordinances. Thou haſt Gods command for thy warrant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3, 5. and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for thy motive. <hi>In all places where I record my name, there I will come and will bleſs thee,</hi> Exod. 20.24. And if thou wouldſt know what bleſſing, what alms God giveth at thoſe places, <hi>There the Lord commandeth his bleſſing, even life for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 133.3. God giveth not ſuch bleſſings any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where as there; there are the mercies of the Throne; pardon, love, peace, converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, increaſe of grace, joy in the Holy Ghoſt; the kidneys of the wheat, the fineſt of the flowre, and the honey out of the rock of mercy. It is ſaid of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that he impoveriſhed all his Empire to enrich <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> God doth paſs by other parts of the world as waſte ground, or as a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; but the place where he records his
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:170410:224"/>Name is his garden: that he will dung, and dig, and dreſs, and take care that it bring forth good fruit; <hi>there he commands his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> It is an alluſion poſſibly to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to a General, or an Emperor; <hi>Where the word of a King, is there is power:</hi> The Centurion ſaid, <hi>I ſay to one Souldier, Go, and he goeth; to another, Come, and he commeth; to a third, Do this, and he doth it.</hi> So God commandeth one ordinance, <hi>Go and build up ſuch a Saint,</hi> and it goeth; he ſaith to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinance, <hi>Come and call home ſuch a ſinner,</hi> and it doth it; Gods word and work goe together. Men cannot enable others, or give them power to obey them; they may bid a lame man walk, or a blinde man ſee, but they cannot enable them to walk or ſee; God with his word giveth ſtrength to do the thing commanded; as in the old, ſo in the new creation, <hi>He ſpake, and it was done, he commanded, and it ſtood faſt,</hi> Pſal. 33.9.

               </p>
               <p>Thou heareſt, Reader, where thy wants may be ſupplied, through what pipes the water of life is conveyed; do thou like the impotent man, wait at the porch of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Temple, begging and expecting ſome
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:170410:225"/>alms, God may do more for thee (as for him, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.2, 8.) then thou doſt ask or think.</p>
               <p>It was as eaſie for <hi>Boaz</hi> (and it might have been done with as little charge) to have given <hi>Ruth</hi> as much corn at firſt as would have yeilded an Epah of barley, and ſo have ſent her away without any more ado; but he will have her glean it, and then break it. So God could infuſe Grace immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but he will have men hear, read, and pray, attend on Ordinances, though not as maſters, yet as means of Grace; He giveth earthly riches to them that are diligent in their particular callings; ſo he giveth heavenly riches to them that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent about their general calling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve in this third help <hi>a ſerious conſtant uſe of all the means of Grace appointed for this end; David</hi> in meditation findeth the Spirit kindling that fire, which at laſt broke out into an holy flame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3. <hi>While I was muſing the fire burned.</hi>

               <p>The two diſciples at godly conference, found Jeſus Chriſt to make a third; while they were diſcourſing of him, he preſents himſelf to them, cauſeth their hearts to burn within them, and openeth their eyes to know him.

               <p>The Eunuch was reading the Scripture, when <hi>Philip</hi> was commanded by commiſſion from the Holy Ghoſt, to joyn himſelf to his Chariot, and to inſtuct him in the knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Junius,</hi> by reading <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> by reading <hi>Romans</hi> 13. were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:170410:226"/>The three thouſand (<hi>Act.</hi> 3.) by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came to love; and truly many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have found the Goſpel of Chriſt preached, to become the power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation. <hi>Cyprian</hi> confeſſeth that he was converted from idolatry, and negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, by hearing the hiſtory of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jonas</hi> read, and expounded by <hi>Cecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whom therefore he calleth the father of his new life. Faith and repentance are both wrought by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.37. The wandring ſinner is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reduced by the Scripture, either read or heard; God cals to him when he is running away, ſaying, <hi>Return, Return, O Shulamite, Return, Return.</hi> In all Gods great works, there is ordinarily, a word accompanying it, as in the creation <hi>God ſaid, Let there be light;</hi> when Chriſt raiſed <hi>Lazarus, Lazarus come forth;</hi> when he converted <hi>Paul, Saul, Saul, why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me?</hi> At the great day, <hi>Ariſe ye dead and come to judgment;</hi> The Devil got in at firſt, into mans heart by his eare. The Dragon bites the Elephants eare, and thence ſucks his blood, knowing that to be the onely place, which he cannot reach with his trunk to defend. The Spirit of God comes in with the word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>As that word of God to <hi>Abraham, Sarah thy wife ſhall have a Son, Gen.</hi> 18.10. That word I ſay gave birth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:170410:226"/>to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when there was no likelyhood or poſſibility of his being; from his parents, ſo the word of God give a ſpiritual birth, and being to men and women, when there is no likelyhood or poſſibility in nature, yea when their natures are in flat oppoſition and contrariety to it.</p>
               <p>The word diſcovereth our diſeaſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.9. makes us feel our ſickneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. applyeth the medicine for our cure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.</p>

               <p>Thus thou ſeeſt that the Phyſitian of ſouls hath ſeveral meanes for the cure of thy mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; do not thou neglect any, neither read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor hearing, neither faſting nor praying, neither meditation nor godly conference, neither ſecret nor private, nor publike du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for thou knoweſt not which may do the deed. Chriſt may wait at that very door which thou keepeſt ſhut, at that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which thou omitteſt, to enter into thy ſoul. If thou deſireſt that he ſhould meet thee in any duty, do thou meet him in every duty. How fooliſh art thou to take any one horſe out of the team, when the load is ſo weighty, even thine endleſs wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and all little little enough, to draw
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:170410:227"/>thine untoward heart towards heaven. The Husbandman that hath a piece of ground which lyeth at the end of his fallow, ſtill balked before, will be ſure to plough that up, and expecteth a better crop out of that, then out of any ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ground in the field. Reader, if thou haſt balked any of the forementioned duties, for thy ſouls ſake ſet upon it ſpeedily, for undoubtedly thou mayſt reap a greater har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt by it then thou imagineſt.</p>
               <p>Friend, have a care of ſecret, private, publike duties, for all muſt be minded by them that would be new-moulded. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands among us do wilfully murder their ſouls! ſome poiſon them by crying enormities, others ſtarve them by the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of duties. It was a pitiful equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> (before <hi>Harlem,</hi> that promiſed the Souldiers their lives, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards kild them with hunger) ſaying, <hi>That though he promiſed them their lives, yet he did not promiſe that they ſhould have food.</hi> Art not thou a cheater, and murderer of thy foul, in promiſing it ſpiritual life, when thou denyeſt it the means of life? As ever thou wouldſt have an harveſt of grace, do thou plough up, and ſow the ground of thine heart, with all the means which God hath ordained for that end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, be thou <hi>ſerious</hi> in thine atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the ordinances of God. Be in earneſt when thou art about ſoul affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:170410:227"/>when thou art praying, or hearing, or reading, or conferring with Chriſtians, it is for thy life, it is for thy ſoul, it is for eternity, and do whatſoever the Lord calleth thee to do for the quickening thy dying ſoul with all thine heart, with all thy might; for there is no doing it in the grave, whither thou art haſtening. When <hi>Samſon</hi> would deſtroy the enemies of God, <hi>He bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all his might. Judg.</hi> 16.30. When <hi>David</hi> was waiting upon the Ark of God, <hi>He danced before the Lord with all his might.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.14. So when thou heareſt for the death of thy ſins, thou ſhouldſt hear with all thy might, <hi>Ezek</hi> 40.4. When thou prayeſt for the life of thy ſoul, thou ſhouldſt pray with all thy might, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. Ah how ſhould they hear and read and pray for regeneration, that have but a few days (nay hours poſſibly) to do it in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom and eternal burnings there is but a little airy breath, and if they be not Regenerated before they die, they are ruined, they are damned for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver!</p>
               <p>A childe may handle the mothers breſt, and play with it, and kiſſe it, but all this while he gets no good, till at laſt he layeth his mouth to the breaſt, gets the Nipple faſt, ſucks with his might and ſtrength, and then he draweth nouriſhment; Reader, it may be, thou haſt minded duties, and frequented ordinances, yet poſſibly haſt got no good
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:170410:228"/>by them; 'tis likely then that thou doſt but play with them, dally about them, doing them as if thou didſt them not; if ever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wouldſt get good by them, thou muſt be ſerious and in earneſt about them, do them with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength, knowing that they are of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite weight, and endleſs concernment to thee, conſidering that if God do not now hear thee (in thy day of grace) he will never, never hear thee; and if thou do not now hear him, thou ſhalt ſhortly never, never more have ſuch an offer.</p>
               <p>I doubt not friend, but thou art ſerious about toys and trifles; thou canſt riſe early and go to bed late, and work hard all day, and have thy mind ſtedfaſtly occupied about theſe fooliſh things of the world, from which within a ſhort time, thou ſhalt be parted for ever. How buſie are vain men like a company of Ants, to increaſe their heap of earth. O think of it, is it not pity ſuch a plant ſhould grow in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which would thrive ſo well in <hi>Canaan?</hi> How fitly, how finely would that ſeriouſneſs and fervency which thou uſeſt about earth, become and ſute with heaven! Ah twould be worth the while, to be moſt covetous and ſedulous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of God, and Chriſt, thy ſoul and Eternity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Be <hi>conſtant</hi> in the uſe of the means of Grace; pray and wait, hear and wait, read and wait, watch and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:170410:228"/>wait; <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, in the evening with-hold not thine hand; for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, either this, or that, or whether they both ſhall be alike good,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.6. in every morning <hi>ſow thy ſeed,</hi> pray, read, meditate; in the evening <hi>with-hold not thine hand,</hi> do the ſame; for thou knoweſt not which ſhall proſper, at which the Spirit of God will give thee a gracious effectual meeting for thy converſion or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or whether both ſhall conduce equally to thy ſpiritual and eternal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; Do not expect, like the <hi>Hyperboreans,</hi> to ſow and reap in a day; allow ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between ſeed time and harveſt. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick doth not work immediately when its ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the body; be confident, thou ſhalt reap in time if thou doſt not faint.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe thou wert ſick of ſome mortal painful diſeaſe, a dead man in thy own and others thoughts; and an able faithful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian ſhould warrant thy cure in time, upon condition that thou wouldſt follow his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and diet thy ſelf all the while; wouldſt thou not uſe all that he preſcribed, and wait, and long to be recovered? Thou waſt wounded in a moment, but art not ſo ſoon recovered; 'tis good to wait Gods leiſure; what Chriſt ſaid in regard of his coming in Judgement, I ſay in regard of his coming in mercy, <hi>Watch therefore, for thou knoweſt not when the Son of Man will come,</hi> whether this day, to morrow, or next week; loſe

               <p>Reader, Lie at the pool, and give not over, till the Angel doth move upon the waters. When one of the Fathers had it ſuggeſted to him by the Devil, That it was in vain for him to minde God, for he ſhould never get to Heaven: Then ſaith he, <hi>I will follow hard after God, that I may enjoy as much of him as is poſſible on earth.</hi> When Blinde <hi>Bartimens</hi> was rebuked by the Diſciples for calling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt for his bodily ſight, he cryeth the more earneſtly, <hi>Jeſus thou Son of David, have mercy on me,</hi> Mark 10.15. What ever diſcouragements thou meeteſt with in thine attendance on God in Ordinances, be like the Engliſh Jet fired by water, and not like our ordinary fires, quenched by it; let them add to, not diminiſh thy reſolution and courage; let not one repulſe beat thee off; be violent, give a ſecond ſtorm to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. Parents ſometimes hide themſelves to make their children continue ſeeking. He that would not at firſt open his mouth, nor vouchſafe the woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> a word, doth (upon her continued

               <p>And truly, if after all thy pains thou findeſt Jeſus Chriſt, will it not make amends for thy long patience?

Suppoſe thou ſhouldſt continue knocking twenty, nay, forty years, yet if at laſt, though but one hour before thou dieſt, thy heart be opened to Chriſt, and he be received into thy ſoul, and when thou dieſt Heaven be opened to thee, and thy ſoul received into it; will it not infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requite thee for all thy labour!

               <head>The firſt Objection anſwered; namely, Mans weakneſs and inability to turn unto God.</head>
               <p>THou mayſt probably object againſt this Exhortation to minde Regeneration, <hi>That thou haſt no power to leave and loath ſin, to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:170410:231"/>believe in, and ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, why do I call upon thee ſo earneſtly? to what purpoſe do I bid thee make thee a new heart, and a new ſpirit, turn unto God, and embrace his onely Son as thy Lord?</p>
               <p>To this and the other ſubſequent objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concerning Election, and thy ſinfulneſs in performing duties, I might anſwer onely with the Apoſtle, <hi>Who art thou that replyeſt againſt God,</hi> Rom. 9.20. or with <hi>Eliphaz, Shall mortal man be more juſt then God? ſhall a man be more pure then his Maker?</hi> Job 4.17. But I will anſwer with <hi>Elihu, Suffer me a little, and I will ſhew thee, what I have to ſpeak on Gods behalf; I will fetch my knowledg from a far, and will aſcribe righteouſneſs to my maker. For truly my words ſhall not be falſe; He that is perfect in knowledge is with me.</hi> Job 36.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I confeſſe,
<note place="margin">See more of mans Impotency p. 111. to 117.</note> that thou art unable either to loath ſin or love God, by thine own ſtrength. The precepts of the word ſpeak mans duty, but Gods power; They teach us not what we can do, but what we ſhould do; becauſe a man ought to pay his debts, therefore it doth not follow that he is able to pay them. Divine commands are to convince men of their weakneſs, not to ſhew their ſtrength. I acknowledg that by nature thou art <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> and canſt neither ſee, nor hear, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſpiritual things, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. Thou art <hi>without ſtrength, Rom.</hi> 5.6. not able to think a
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:170410:232"/>good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. nor to ſpeak a good word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.34. nay, thou canſt do nothing that is acceptable to God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. or profitable to thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None can be aforehand with God. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeek him, till we have found him; he will be ſought, that he may be found, and found that he may be ſought, ſaith</hi> Bernard.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer that the cauſe of mans weakneſs is from himſelf, the fault is not in God. <hi>God made man upright, but he hath found out many inventions, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. What was there wanting on Gods part? He created man after his own image, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, righteouſneſs, and true holineſs, he gives him a law to direct him, a threatning to warn him, a promiſe to encourage him, ability and power to carry himſelf uprightly. Man hearkeneth to Satan, diſtruſteth God, deſpiſeth the Law, tryeth new inventions, whereby he undoeth himſelf; Is God to be blamed? Surely no. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth againſt the Lord.</hi> Pro. 19.3.</p>
               <p>If thou urgeſt the objection farther, That one man ſinned and the whole genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men ſuffer; that thy weakneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from thy fall, but <hi>Adams;</hi> I anſwer, That a child may as well complain that his Prince is unjuſt, becauſe he is born the Son of a Beggar, or a Traytour; indeed it is an unhappineſs to thee, that thou art ſo deſcended, but not unrighteouſneſs in
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:170410:232"/>God. If God gave thy father an earthly eſtate of a thouſand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and he prove a prodigal, and leave thee not a thouſand farthings, wilt thou blame God? Is he to be charged for thy fathers riotouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? truly thus it is in ſpirituals; God gave <hi>Adam</hi> a ſufficient ſtock, he waſted it by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſobeying the command given him, and thereby leaves all his children poor and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly; is God now in the leaſt fault? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt loſt thy power of obeying? ſhould God therefore loſe his right of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding? a ſervant that makes himſelf drunk, and thereby unable to do his Maſters work, is not therefore diſobliged from his ſervice. A prodigal debter though he hath ſpent his eſtate in drinking and dicing, may juſtly be called upon, and ſued for his debts.</p>
               <p>But thou mayſt ſayſt ſay, thou didſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to truſt thy ſtock in <hi>Adams</hi> hands. I reply, Hath not a father power to oblige and bind his ſon? <hi>Adam</hi> was the father of all, and did bear without queſtion, an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary natural affection to his children; His own intereſt was involved with theirs; he and they lived and died, ſtood and fell together; he had full power over his own will; Satan could not force him to ſin; his obedience for all was no leſs eaſie then for himſelf. There was nothing commanded him but what was equal and juſt, and what he was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enabled to do. If <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, thou hadſt ſhared in his gains, which had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:170410:233"/>great, therefore it is but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that thou ſhouldſt ſhare in his loſſes.</p>

This way made moſt for mans ſafety and quiet.

               <p>Thou hadſt a poiſonous egg from thy father, but the Serpent that ſtings thee to death is from thy warming and hatching that egg in thine own breaſt; All the men on earth, and all the devils in hell could not damn thee, were it not for thy wilfulneſs in ſin: And canſt thou expect that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſave thee againſt thine own will? that he ſhould carry thee to heaven whether thou wilt or no? Believe it, a ſtate
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:170410:234"/>of ſin and wrath, is the matter of thine own choice. The door which ſhuts thee out of the fathers houſe, is bolted againſt thee by thine own hands.</p>
               <p>Anſwer me this queſtion, or elſe never more make this objection; Art thou willing to turn from ſin, unto God? Art thou willing to take the ſon of God for thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Lord? If thou art willing, I am ſure God is willing; he hath confirmd it with an oath. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. Jeſus Chriſt is willing that ſinners ſhould live, or he would not ſo willingly have died ſuch a death; he hath paid the price of thy ranſom, and offereth thee an happier eſtate then that of which <hi>Adam</hi> deprived thee. If thou art willing to accept of thy freedom thou mayſt have it. <hi>If any man will, let him drink of the water of life freely. Rev.</hi> 22. And if thou art not willing, why doſt thou complain.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, the fault is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thy ſelf, becauſe thou neglecteſt to do what thou haſt power to do; Thou haſt power, without any ſpecial grace, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties, to hear the word, to pray in ſecret, and with thy family, to forbear thy wicked company, thy ſwearing, lying, drinking, ſcoffing at godlineſs, and yet doſt not mind thoſe duties conſtantly, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear thoſe ſins; ſhall a ſervant (friend, be thine own judge) which is truſted with five pound to imploy for his Maſters honour, ſpend this in whoring and gaming, and then
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:170410:234"/>blame his maſter for not truſting him with thouſands? When man broke by his fall, there was ſome ſtock left in his hands (not enough to ſet him up again, but that) which might do him ſome good; now they ſpend this profuſely, they throw away thoſe checks of conſcience, which eſcaped the ruines of the fall; they corrupt themſelves in what they know, and wickedly refuſe to do what they can, and yet are ſo impudent as to flie in the face of the ever-bleſſed God, that he doth not give them power to do more.</p>

               <head>The ſecond objection anſwered: That unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men ſin in performing duties, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on ordinances.</head>
               <p>SEcondly, it may be, thou wilt ſay, You preſſe me much to pray, and hear, and frequent the means of grace; but I ſin in doing ſo; I ſin in praying, I ſin in hearing, and ſinging; and would you have me ſin?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; Firſt thou ſinneſt in eating, and drinking, and following thy calling, in not doing theſe things upon right principles, and for right ends; and wilt thou therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear them? thou wilt pamper and pleaſe thy body, right or wrong, not onely in the uſe, but even in the abuſe of the creatures; but how ordinary an excuſe will make thee neglect thy ſoul?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Regenerate men themſelves ſin in all their performances (though not in ſuch a manner as unregenerate ones do) and ſhould they therefore lay them down?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, no pretence whatſoever can excuſe from obedience to clear precepts (remember alſo that the commands of God do not interfere or contradict each other.) Now God expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee, though thou art in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtate, to perform duties. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he had told <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that he was in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity, yet
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:170410:235"/>he bids him pray to the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22. if peradventure the thoughts of his heart might be forgiven him: our ſinning in duties can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abrogate that Law of God which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns duties; as Gods precepts are not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of our ſtrength, ſo they are not leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our weakneſs. The <hi>Ninivites,</hi> though unregenerate (as ſome think) yet when threatned with deſtruction, did both pray and faſt, and found that it was not in vain, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.3.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, thou ſinneſt leſs in performing duties then in neglecting them: If thou art reſolved to go on in a courſe of ſinning, and damning thy ſoul, I know not what to ſay to thee; the Lord pitty thee; but if thou haſt any deſire of Salvation in a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, thou offendeſt far far leſs in waiting on God in his Ordinances, then thoſe do that refuſe them; in performing duties without ſuitable grace, thou faileſt in the manner of Divine worſhip; others that omit duties, fail both in the matter and manner: thou oweſt God outward as well as inward ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; the confeſſion of thy mouth, as well as the converſion of thine heart; ſurely then, if thou giveſt God the former, though without the latter, thou doſt not ſin ſo much as they that give him neither.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſhouldſt thou neglect the means of grace, thou wouldſt make thy condition (which is already dreadful) to be deſperate; if ever God meet thee, it muſt be in his own
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:170410:236"/>way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15, 17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. I believe thou ſcarce ever heardſt of any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, while he caſt by the means of grace which God afforded him.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If thy condition be ſo ſad, that thou ſinneſt in all thou doſt, thou haſt the more need to haſten out of it: Ah, who would be quiet one hour in ſuch an eſtate wherein what ever he doth is abominable to God! Men, that are weak and ſickly, do not therefore forbear food, becauſe they are not able to digeſt it well, and it may poſſibly yeild ſome nouriſhment to their diſeaſe, but do therefore eat that they may get ſtrength, and be enabled to overcome their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, God may meet with thee in the means of Grace. The Ordinances of God are the golden pipes through which he conveyeth the oil of Grace from Chriſt the olive tree: God doth not bid thee to wait upon him for nothing; thouſands have found by happy experience, that they are bleſſed which watch at Wiſdoms gate, which wait at the poſts of her doors, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. latter end. The <hi>Ninivites</hi> (when <hi>Jonah</hi> had foretold their ruine) faſt and pray, ſaying, <hi>Who can tell if God will repent and turn from his fierce anger that we periſh not!</hi> Jonah 3.9. So now God hath foretold in his word the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all in thy condition; do thou faſt and pray, read and meditate; who can tell but God may turn and have mercy upon
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:170410:236"/>thee, pour down his Spirit and holineſs into thee, that thou periſh not! Thou mayſt hear and read of the ſucceſs of others; others have found him in his houſe of prayer, and why not thou? The Mariner cannot make either winde or tide, yet he lieth ready upon the waters and waits for them. The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman cannot cauſe an harveſt, yet he ploughs and ſoweth, hoping that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens will help him; Thou canſt not heal thy ſelf, wait therefore at the means, Chriſt may come when thou little thinkeſt of it and cure thee; God delights to bleſs mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; his uſual courſe is to meet them that meet him; he hath been found of them that ſought him not, and will he hide himſelf from thee when thou ſeekeſt his face? for thine encouragement thou haſt his word, (which is truth it ſelf) That if thou ſeek him early, thou ſhalt finde him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17.

               <head>The third and laſt Objection anſwered: If I be elected I ſhall be ſaved, let me live never ſo wickedly, and neglect the means preſcribed for my recovery.</head>
               <p>THirdly, It is poſſible thou mayſt object, That if thou art predeſtinated to life,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:170410:237"/>thou ſhalt be ſaved, though thou neglecteſt all theſe means of ſalvation; and if thou art not elected, theſe will do thee no good.</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, that this looks like the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of one already in Hell, though it be found too too often in the mouths of ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers upon earth; in evil things the Devil would make thee ſeparate the end from the means; <hi>Think not of Hell, but go on in ſin, ſaith he;</hi> in good things the means from the end; <hi>never trouble thy ſelf with holineſs, yet doubt not of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe that thou ſhouldſt live and die in this deſperate concluſion, wouldſt not thou certainly be damned? without all controverſie, in the other world thou wouldſt finde what a fine cheat the Devil had put upon thee, by bringing thee into an opinion, which will bring thee inevitably into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Believe it, thou ſhalt know in the other world who ſhall have the worſt of ſuch curſed concluſions, God or thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Decree of God is a ſealed book, and the names in it are ſecret; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy part is to look to Gods revealed will; namely, to make thine Election ſure, by making thy Regeneration ſure: Doſt thou not know that ſecret things belong to God, but revealed things to us and our children? O 'tis dangerous to meddle with the ſecrets of Princes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This opinion is not believed by thee, but is onely pretended as a cloak for
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:170410:237"/>thy wickedneſs and idleneſs; for if thou doſt believe that if God hath elected, he will ſave thee however thou liveſt; why are not thy practices anſwerable to ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? why doſt thou not leave thy ground unſowed, and thy calling unfollowed, and ſay, <hi>If God hath decreed me a crop of corn I ſhall have it, whether I ſow my ground or no; and if God hath decreed me an eſtate I ſhall have it, though I never minde my calling?</hi> why doſt thou not neglect and refuſe eating and drinking, and ſleeping, and ſay, If God have decreed that I ſhall live longer, I ſhall do it, though I never eat, or drink, or ſleep? for God hath decreed theſe things concerning thy ground, eſtate, and natural life, as well as concerning thine eternal condition in the other world. When I ſee that thou throweſt off all care and means of preſerving thy life on earth, &amp; expecteſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to continue alive, then I may believe that thy forementioned thoughts are really ſuch in regard of eternal life; but till then I ſhall be confident that this concluſion is onely a feigned plea in the behalf of the Devil and thy carnal corruptions.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The word of God, which muſt ſhortly try thee for thine everlaſting life or death, doth declare to thee fully and clearly, that God predeſtinateth to the means as well as the end; where then wilt thou appear that neglecteſt the means? that the means and end are joyned together
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:170410:238"/>in Gods decree, is fully proved to thee in the 53 and 331 pages of this book; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not Satan ſo far delude thee, as to make thee part them. I ſhall conclude my anſwer to this objection (for truly 'tis ſo irrational, that I do not think it worthy of ſix lines) with a ſtory which I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time read; <hi>Ludovicus</hi> a learned man of <hi>Italy,</hi> by ſinful beginnings came at laſt to this concluſion, <hi>It matters not what I do, or how I live; if I be predeſtinated to life, I am ſure to be ſaved; if otherwiſe, I cannot help it.</hi> Thus with this deſperate opinion he lived a long time, till at laſt he fell dangerouſly ſick, and ſent for a skilful Phyſitian, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring his advice; the Phyſitian before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand acquainted with his opinion, told him, <hi>Surely it will be needleſs to uſe any means for your recovery; for if the time of your death be come, it will be impoſſible to avoid it: Ludovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> upon this began to conſider of his own madneſs and folly in neglecting the means for his ſoul, bemoaned his ſin ſincerely, took phyſick, and was through the bleſſing of God recovered both in ſoul and body. O that what I have written might work ſuch an effect upon thy ſpirit! Conſider, Friend, if notwithſtanding Gods Decree, means muſt be uſed for thy temporal eſtate, ſhould they not alſo for thine eternal eſtate? <hi>Be not wiſe in thine own eyes, but fear the Lord and depart from evil; Labour to cleanſe thy ways by taking heed thereto according to his word,</hi> Prov. 3.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9.</p>

               <p>REader I have now finiſhed this weighty exhortation which doth ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thy precious ſoul, and unchangeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the other world. Thou ſeeſt how large an epiſtle I have written to thee with mine own hand; many an hours ſleep have I loſt, to awaken thee out of thy carnal ſecurity; but I am ignorant whether the work be done or no, which is of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable waight; or whether thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſet upon it, through the ſtrength of Chriſt in good earneſt. I preach to thee, I pray for thee, I deſire and endeavour ſo to live as to ſet thee a pattern; O that I knew what to do, that might be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for thy recovery. Friend, ponder ſeriouſly the truth and concernment of the particulars delivered. Is there not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite reaſon why thou ſhouldſt ſpeedily and heartily ſubmit to the counſel of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for the enlivening of thy dying ſoul! What more weighty buſines haſt thou to do then to ſet upon thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mayſt avoid unquenchable burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and arive at fulneſs of joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore? Is thy ploughing or ſowing, thy buying or ſelling, nay thine eating and drinking, half ſo neceſſary as the Regeneration of thy ſoul, without which the everliving God hath told thee over and over, that thou ſhalt not be ſaved! O that thou didſt but believe what it is
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:170410:239"/>to be in heaven or hell, for ever, ever, ever.</p>
               <p>I have read of a woman, that when her houſe was on fire, ſhe was very buſie, and wrought hard in carrying out her goods; but at laſt bethought her ſelf of her onely child which ſhe never minded before, (for eagerneſs about her goods) but had left it burning in the flames, and then when it was too late, ſhe cryeth, and roareth out ſadly, <hi>O my child, Ah my poor child!</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou art in danger, thine everlaſting eſtate is every moment in jeopardy, if thou now buſieſt thy ſelf wholly in ſcraping and carking and caring for thy body, forgetting thy poor ſoul, leaving that to the fire, that ſhall never go out; conſider there is a time (I would ſay an eternity) coming when thou wilt think of it, though then twill be too late, and then, O then, how ſadly, how ſorrowfully wilt thou ſigh and ſob, howl and roare, and ſcreech out, <hi>O my ſoul, Ah my poor ſoul, how wretchedly have I forgot my precious ſoul!</hi> It is an unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercy, that yet thou haſt a day of grace, wherein thou mayſt think of, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the good of thy ſoul. For thy ſouls ſake, for the Lords ſake, O dear friend, mind it ſpeedily; hear God now he calleth, or then (though thou calleſt loud and long) he will never, never, hear thee.

               </p>
               <p>Firſt be thou thankful to God; What wilt thou render to the Lord for this great ineſtimable benefit? Is not thine heart ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed in the conſideration of that good wil, which took ſuch notice of thee a poor worm! <hi>Praiſe</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>waiteth for thee in Sion,</hi> Pſal. 65.1. and well it may; for of <hi>Sion it may be ſaid, This and that man was born in her.

Thou canſt never give too great thanks for whom God hath wrought ſuch great things. Do thou ſay, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for me whereof I am glad,</hi> Pſ. 125.3. What joy is there at the birth of a great heir, or a prince!

Do wicked men keep the day of their natural births, with ſo much pleaſure and delight, when they were therein born in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity; when by reaſon of thoſe births, they are obnoxious to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death? and wilt thou not keep the day of thy ſpiritual birth with joy, whereby thou art purified from thy natural pollution, and aſſured of entrance, into the purchaſed poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion where thou ſhalt be perfectly purified?</p>

Thou art called to be a Son of God, a coheir with Chriſt, a Citizen of <hi>Sion:</hi> The Son of a King muſt, like <hi>Abſolom,</hi> be without blemiſh from top to toe; <hi>That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the ſons of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebuke,</hi> Phil. 2.15. Adoption is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation out of one Family into another, and doth diſoblige thee from the Laws of Satan and his Family, and oblige thee to the rules and orders of Chriſt and his Houſe, into which thou art taken. Thou art called to be a King, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>It is not for Kings to drink wine, nor Princes ſtrong drink,</hi> Pro. 31. that is, immoderately; ſuch a ſin is very bad in a Subject, but much worſe in a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; as a ſpot in ſcarlet is worſe then in ſackcloth. The tranſgreſſions of others have much rebellion and obſtinacy in them; but thy ſins have more of unkindneſs and treachery, as being againſt the Covenant:
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:170410:244"/>Thou art called to reign with Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>O walk worthy of him that hath called thee unto his Kingdom and glory,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.12. Thou that haſt hopes to be like Chriſt in glory, ſhouldſt labour, as for life, to be like him in grace, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.
<note place="margin">Plutarch in vit. Iul. Caeſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> when he heard that <hi>Brutus</hi> conſpired againſt him, would not believe it, but ſaid, <hi>He looks for this skin,</hi> meaning, he expecteth to be my heir, to ſucceed me in the Empire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not be ſo unworthy as to plot againſt me. Reader, hath not Chriſt more cauſe to expect that thy preſent deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be anſwerable to thy future pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy calling is holy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy carriage ſhould be holy; other callings may put glory upon a man, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not infuſe grace into a man; other callings may change thy condition, but this hath changed thy diſpoſition: Thou art called to be a Saint, ſhouldſt thou not then live as a Saint? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Alexander</hi> would often bid a Captain of his name,
<note place="margin">Recordare nominis Alexander.</note> 
                  <hi>Remember that thou art called Alexander;</hi> that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain remembring his name might do nothing unworthy of it: Truly, ſo ſay I to thee, Remember that thou art called to be a Saint, to be a Chriſtian, and do not by the unexemplarineſs of thy life cauſe that worthy name by which thou art called to be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy calling is heavenly, Hebr.</hi> 3.1. and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:170410:245"/>therefore thy converſation ſhould be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it is from God, and therefore muſt lead thee to God. O how ſtately is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of wordlings, when they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to high employments! how little ſhould all the things on earth be in thine eyes who art fixed in heaven! <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> walking with one by the Sea-ſide, and ſeeing a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treaſure on the earth, ſaid to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-traveller, <hi>Do thou take it up, fer thou art not Themiſtocles.</hi> If the men of the world, whoſe portions are in this life, have their affections ſet on things below, and their converſations on earth, remember that thy treaſure is in heaven, and thine heart muſt be there alſo; live as one that belongs to another Country. In a word, ſtudy, ſtrive, labour, endeavour, watch, pray, hear, read, meditate, that thou mayſt in private, in publick, upon all occaſions, in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in all manner of converſation <hi>ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called thee out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9, 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As thou ſhouldſt be thankful to God, ſo alſo faithful to men; Thou art converted thy ſelf, do thine utmoſt to convert others. The Lepers coming into the Syrian Camp, and finding food enough to relieve themſelves and many others ready to periſh with hunger, they firſt feaſted themſelves, and afterwards ſay one to another, <hi>We do not well; this day is a day of good tydings, and
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:170410:245"/>we hold our peace; if we tarry till the morning light, ſome miſchief will befall us: now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come, that we may go and tell the Kings houſhold,</hi> 2. Kings 7.9. The time was when thou like the Lepers, waſt famiſhing thy ſoul with the huskes of the world; now God hath fed thee with the fat things of his houſe; doſt thou well to hold thy peace? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them that are pinched with hunger, and call them to Gods Courts; tell them what large proviſion he maketh, how the table is ſpread, his oxen, his fatlings are killed, all things ready; he wanteth onely comers and company; thou doſt well to take hold for thy ſelf, but thou doſt ill if thou with-holdſt from others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi> was commanded to pity ſtrangers, becauſe they were once ſtrangers in the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Shouldſt not thou compaſſionate them that are ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, aliens from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> carried captive by the Devil at his will, conſidering that thou waſt in that houſe of bondage, in as great ſlavery to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and ſubjection to ſin as others, and it was nothing but Grace and Mercy that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee? <hi>Put them in minde</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to be gentle, ſhewing all meekneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men:</hi> Why, upon what conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>For we ourſelves alſo were ſometimes fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures — but after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:170410:246"/>not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 3 Tit. 1. to 8.</p>
               <p>Wicked men are like thoſe that are drowning, they catch hold on others, and if it be poſſible, make them ſink with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; godly men muſt be like candles, which being lighted kindle others.</p>
               <p>Grace is compared to oil, which is of a diffuſive ſpreading nature;
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.4.</note> and it doth like the oil in the widows barrel increaſe by pouring out; the oil never ceaſed running, till ſhe ceaſed pouring: The more thou im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveſt thy little ſtock of Grace, the more thy maſter will truſt thee with. <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome mountains of ſalt in <hi>Cumana,</hi> which whilſt they lay common for the good of many never waſted, though Merchants carried away in abundance; but when they were once ingroſſed to one mans uſe, they conſumed away. He that hath greateſt layings out for God, ſhall have greateſt comings in from God. The loaves increaſed not whilſt they were whole in the basket, but whilſt they were breaking and diſtributing to others. Womens milk increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by drawing; if the breſt be not drawn, it will dry up.
<note place="margin">Prov. 11.14, 15.</note> He that ſoweth liberally, ſhall reap liberally. Believe it, Friend, the onely way to make thy one pound, ten pounds, is by trading with it. I ſpeak not of thy intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into the Miniſters calling, but of dealing
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:170410:246"/>faithfully with the ſouls of thy friends and relations in thy place and ſtation.</p>
               <p>Truly, one would think that every time thou conſidereſt the dreadful danger of poor ſinners, thine heart ſhould almoſt bleed within thee! Jeſus Chriſt groaned and wept for dead <hi>Lazarus.</hi> How did <hi>David</hi> mourn for dead <hi>Abſolom!</hi> At a funeral, though there be much coſt, yet there is no chear, becauſe one is dead. What bowels of pity ſhouldſt thou have towards them that are dead ſpiritually, nay dying eternally! Doſt thou not remember, there was a time when no eye pitied thee, when God paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own blood! yea when thou waſt in thy blood, he ſaid unto thee Live; behold that time was the time of love to thy ſoul; canſt thou now behold others wallowing in their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, weltring in their ſoul blood, and thine eyes not affect thine heart with pity to them! Eſpecially we that are parents, ſhould uſe all means for the Regeneration of our children and relations. <hi>We have a little ſiſter that hath no breaſts, what ſhall we do for her? ſaid the Jews,</hi> Cant. 8.8. Have not we little Children that have no Chriſt, no hope, no grace! O what ſhall we do for them in the day that they ſhall be ſpoken for! When <hi>Samſon</hi> had found honey in the carcaſs of the lyon, he did not onely eat himſelf, but carryed ſome to his father and mother; thou haſt found hony and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:170410:247"/>in the carcaſs of the Lyon, of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> in a crucified Chriſt; wilt thou not endeavour that thy relations and friends may ſhare with thee?</p>
               <p>Friend, canſt thou think without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling on the unnaturalneſs of moſt fathers and mothers, towards their children! All their care is to get earth enough for them, but never mind the inſtating them in heaven; the Oſtrich leaves her eggs in the earth,
<note place="margin">Iob 39.14, 15</note> and warmeth them in the duſt, where the foot cruſheth them, and the wild beaſt breaks them; thus worldly men warm the fruit of their bodies in the earth, are diligent to leave them duſt enough, but conſider not that the foot of Gods fury will cruſh them, and the roaring Lion devoure them, if they be not Regenerated. O the many ſoul murders which worldly parents commit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>! but if thou art born again, I am perſwaded, nay I am confident of better things of thee, thou dareſt not but teach thy ſons Gods ways, and labour that thy ſervants may be converted to him. Chriſtianity doth not diminiſh, but rectify thy natural affection; it cauſeth thee to love thy relations, not leſs but better then thou didſt before; grace makes thy love to run out towards their ſouls, and their ſpiritual and eternal good. O what an honour and priviledge is it, that thou mayſt be inſtrumental for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſouls! <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.2, <hi>ult.</hi> which that thou mayſt be, take theſe three words for thine help.</p>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:170410:247"/>
               <p> Firſt, Be ſure that thou ſet them a good pattern; let thy life be ſo exact, that others may write after thy copy with credit. Look on thy ſelf as new born for this end, that thou mighteſt adorn the Doctrine of God thy Saviour. Parents and Maſters are often authentick patterns, to all their inferiours; their zeal will provoke many; and if they fall, as tall cedars, they beat down many ſhrubs. O therefore do nothing of which thou mayſt not ſay to thy family, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as <hi>Gideon</hi> to his ſouldiers.
<note place="margin">Iudg 7.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Look on me and do likewiſe.</hi> It is reported of the Hares of <hi>Scythia,</hi> that they teach their young ones to leap from bank to bank, from rock to rock, by leaping before them, which otherwiſe they would never learn; and by this means, when they are hunted, no beaſts can overtake them. Do thou ſet others a pattern, in the performance of duties, and in the exerciſe of graces, that others learning by thine example, may thereby be ſecured from Satan the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer.</p>
               <p>The morall is good of the fable; The old crab bid the young one got forward; Shew me the way, ſaith the young crab; the mother goeth backward and ſideling; the daughter followeth her ſaying, <hi>Lo, I go juſt as you do.</hi> Truly, thus thy little ones will quickly imitate thy doings. Be careful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how thou liveſt, walk circumſpectly, conſider of every expreſſion and action, not
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:170410:248"/>onely whether it be lawful, but alſo whether it be expedient and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Thy religious pattern may do more good then the Miniſters preaching; they preach with their lips one day in a weak; but thou by thy life preacheſt all the week long, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. Have thy conſervation honeſt among others, that they may glorifie God in the day of their viſitation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let thy prayers be conſtant and inſtant for their Regeneration; <hi>How can I ſee the death of my childe?</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hagar.</hi> Alas, how canſt thou ſee the eternal death of thy dear children! When thou kneeleſt to prayer with thy wife, children, and ſervants, and conſidereſt that death will ſhortly break up thy houſe, and then heaven and hell will claim their due; The Regenerate ſhall go to heaven, the unregenerate to hell. Thou and they who live together, are likely to be parted aſunder for ever. Good Lord, How ſhouldſt thou pray for them? with what fervency? with what importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Thou art new born, and knoweſt that hell and heaven, are no jeſting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
<note place="margin">Iohn 4.23.</note> doth not thine heart ake to think that any of thine ſhould dwell in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnings; O go to Chriſt as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion for his ſick child, <hi>Sir come down ere my child die.</hi> Lord come down ere my poor children die for ever. And as the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:170410:248"/>woman of <hi>Canaan, Have mercy on me O Lord, thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a devil; Lord help me. If thou canſt do any thing, help them.</hi> Lord pitie poor children, and form thy dear Son in them; thus carry thy little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Jeſus Chriſt, and intreat him to put his hands on them, and bleſs them. <hi>Hannah</hi> by prayer obtaind a <hi>Samuel;</hi> O let us pray hard, that all our ſons may be as gracious as <hi>Samuel,</hi> and all our daught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as full of good works as <hi>Dorcas. Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> ſaid, he never prayd that his ſon might live long, but that he might live well. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was a child of many prayers, and did not periſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Do thine endeavor to regenerate them by inſtructing them in the precepts of God. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba</hi> were often drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtruction into their ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 28.9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.3. to 10. Pious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath made an happy renovation in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſouls. <hi>Teach a childe the trade in his youth, and he ſhall not depart from it when he is old,</hi> Prov. 22.6. Others teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to lie and ſteal, and to curſe and ſweare. I have read a ſtory of a wicked mother that perſwaded her daughter to yield to the luſt of a rich man, in hope that he would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her; the daughter did yield, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after fell ſick and died; the mother here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fell diſtracted, and cried out often, <hi>O my daughters ſoul, O my daughters ſoul! I
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:170410:249"/>have murthered my daughters ſoul.</hi> If others intice their relations to uncleanneſs, ſhall not we encourage ours to holineſs! Whilſt this world laſteth, the Devil will have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; many many fathers bring up their children to his hand. O wilt not thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that when thou art dead, thy little ones may be a generation ariſing to praiſe God! Truly, thy love to God muſt needs oblige thee to do thine utmoſt, that his vaſt perfections, and infinite excellencies may be declared and admired throughout all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melanthon</hi> on a day of prayer went out a little from his company very ſorrowful, and returned in a ſhort time to them very joyful; of which <hi>Luther</hi> asking him the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he gave this account, That there were yong Captains training up (for he had heard many children learning and repeating their ſound Catechiſm) which would defend the cauſe of Chriſt: The good man was exteam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheared, that though the Pope and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſought to undermine the true Religion, yet young children were learning to defend it. Sure I am, thou wilt die with the more comfort, if thou canſt have hopes, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy deceaſe the bleſſed God ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and his Goſpel propagated in the place where thou doſt dwell. And O what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious heaven upon earth will thy houſe be, if the gracious God ſhall ſo proſper thy pattern, prayers and preceps, that (as thou
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:170410:249"/>like the Sun, ſo) thy wife like the Moon, and thy children and ſervants like the Stars, may all ſhine and ſparkle with the light and heat of real holineſs.</p>
               <p>To end all, Look on thy children, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and neighbours, as paſſengers in a boat, and do thou with thy fellow-converts row hard, make uſe of all windes, improve every opportunity to land them all ſafely at the Haven of Heaven.</p>
